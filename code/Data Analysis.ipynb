       " \"hey i recent experienc some sever sleep depriv on top of alreadi have a massiv sleep deficit . essenti i have insomnia from mani , mani complex caus . and long stori short , i have veri sever adhd , and 4 day ago i woke up later in to the day , and i stay up while medic ( dextro-amphetamin sulfat + transderm nicotin \\\\ [ i usual don't use nicotin \\\\ ] ) becaus i had some thing that i had to get done right then and there becaus of deadlin . i couldn't realli fall asleep dure the day due to circadian rhythm be thrown off ( it' worth note that for week my circadian rhythm ha been fuck and it' been hell tri to fix it ) . the follow day with no sleep i didn't take ani medic or caffein , or anyth to help , which would be great if i didn't have adhd becaus i somehow fall asleep better on day that i medic . and the more sleep depriv i get , the more hyperact i get which in return make me more sleep depriv . so when i didn't medic , i still couldn't sleep becaus i wa hyperact and use my phone a lot , and dental pain . i'm not sure if there we'r ani short period where i feel asleep for like 30 minut or not tbh . but then onto the essenti the 3rd day of like no sleep , i didn't medic again , but manag to injur my hip . now thi is where the fact that i have scoliosi and sciatic nerv pain becom veri relev . i typic sleep on my back . not onli wa i have sever dental pain , ( the whole right side of my jaw would randomli start throb with nerv pain ) , but i'm not exactli sure what wa wrong with my low spine , but it would essenti do some restless leg syndrome-lik spasm / kick into the air own it' own involuntarili , except they we'r fill with veri bad instantan nerv pain . and it wa onli in my right leg , which is the one i had mess up in a sever injuri a few year ago . it' also worth note , that i actual also have straight restless leg syndrom , which not onli disrupt my sleep in it' own right , it mean that otc sleep aid like diphenhydramin and doxylamin succin ( and even melatonin ) are probabl a veri bad idea , as not onli are they neurotox due to their anticholinerg effect but will make my restless leg syndrom forc me to do unconsensu mauy thai kick at 3 am , and due to their depress effect i probabl won't recal if i even slept or not . but i think the nerv pain and kick , wa actual due to my postur , as i had to keep reposit my mess up spine ( scoliosi ) and it seem to be somewhat relat to like where my pelvi wa posit . it' worth note that i wa take cyclobenzaprin , 10 mg , which could possibl make the rl wors , but i also clench my jaw in my sleep and have a lot of muscl pain , so it' kinda hard to weigh the pro and con . and i took mayb a total of 25 mg throughout the entir night , becaus i just refus to goto sleep . i also got out of bed for a littl while a coupl of time , to go on my phone and eat food , as i got hungri and can't sleep while hungri , and it' said you shouldn't just lie awak in bed for long period . but then i had to brush my teeth which caus by jaw pain again . toward thi point , i wa basic hallucin , which would wake me up as i wa about to fall asleep again , and my bodi would sometim jolt as i wa about to fall asleep , mind you i haven't had a stimul in at least 40 hour at thi point . it seem like my heart rate and stuff wa natur just too high for my bodi to fall asleep despit not take ani stimul and somehow my eye weren't even remot tire . i end up drink a beer to help calm my sympathet nervou system and my hyperact despit not be a huge fan of ethanol . even then , it took like 1.5- 2 hour to fall asleep and i can't even feel like i actual feel asleep . when i woke up at like 430 pm , it felt like i hadn't sleept but i'm pretti sure i feel asleep around 230-430 am , mayb 5 . when i woke up i took dextro amphetamin , just becaus it seem i fall asleep easier on the day i medic in contrast to not , i then a littl later took a bit more than i usual despit be heavili against it , becaus i'm like brain dead atm , and it realli seem to have exactli no effect , and i'm afraid that if i don't wake up my bodi and mind a bit more so now , then when i actual tri to goto sleep my mind will start race and i won't sleep . so my issu have been adhd , rl , insomnia to begin with , dental nerv pain ( from like my bottom molar to my canin , and it seem idk the fluorid in my toothpast mayb trigger it possibl for hour ) , nerv pain in my right sciatic nerv , neck pain ( i sleep with no pillow tho ) , scoliosi , a realli fuck up circadian rhythm , and an abysm amount of stress and also the effect of sever sleep depriv . the substanc i have at my dispos are dextro-amphetamin ( i'v actual been abl to fall asleep while medic easili , onli becaus i can medit and focu on my breath better and i'm not hyperact , but despit even take a higher dosag earlier , it seem to do absolut noth rn , and i'm dead tire and cognit impair , but i still doubt if i tri to sleep rn that i could ) , caffein , 7 mg transderm nicotin ( no toler realli , rare use it to improv adhd-rel cognit dysfunct and dyslexia but onli use a hand of time ) , nicotin gum that i don't use at all tbh , acetaminophen , naproxen , meloxicam , cyclobenzaprin , diphenhydramin , doxylamin succin , ramelteon , possibl cannabi ( inhal roa , and 0 idea what chemovar ) , buspiron ( probabl not an option , becaus i have fuck all idea what thi drug doe besid make me lighthead , idek if it like a stimul , sed , or fuck both ) , and possibl alcohol . i think that' it tbh , i alreadi took onli dextro-amphetamin at 5pm realli onli to wake up so i'd be tire when i tri to sleep but it' like i didn't even take it tbh , and my adhd make me hyperact when i tri to sleep , so idk if i should tri to use it to sleep or not take it at all . the reason i can't go to my doctor is becaus well a . it' sunday , b . idk when i could get an appoint . c . i have adhd and doctor don't like prescrib sed becaus some caus paradox advers reaction , and other doctor are against prescrib a sed if you take a stimul , even for short-term use \\\\ [ which is probabl the onli use for a sed drug tbh \\\\ ] . so doe anyon have the best cours of action here , becaus i'm at a fuck loss as to what i should do . if it' not one thing , it' anoth like i forgot to eat and then i can't sleep becaus i'm hungri , or i'm have nerv pain which is essenti imposs to sleep with or at least for me it is . i'm tri to do thing correctli , but it realli seem like a dilemma where there' no good option and even when it seem i did everyth to the best of my abil , then it just seem my bodi refus to sleep for fuck all reason , or a reason i can't figur , and probabl becaus i'm so god damn sleep depriv . so pleas , if anyon ha experi or expertis in or ani fuck input at all . pleas advis me what to do potenti , do keep in mind there' like a 1,000 fuck variabl at play . thank you for at least read thi ! \",\n",
