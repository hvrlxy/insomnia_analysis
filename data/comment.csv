0,hdysfhh,,,insomnia,1632406331,"&gt; It takes me anywhere between 5-8 hours to fall asleep most nights, which means I wake up very late in the day.

If your circadian rhythm is anchored late in the day, you're in bed too early and total time is way, way too long. If you want to sleep at night (i.e. 11pm-12am) you'll have to get up 8h after that, approx 7-8am, consistently. That's the only way you'll build sufficient sleep pressure at night. If you're a teenager and it sounds like you are, you can do 9 hours."
1,hdyqj2t,,,insomnia,1632405494,"Yea, it's tough you should try and manage it."
2,hdyq6b3,,,insomnia,1632405336,"One what? One pill? One pill can contain 10 mg melatonin, 1 pill can contain 5 mg melatonin. Hell it can contain 25 mg melatonin. Whatever amount it is, decrease the dosage."
3,hdyq3p8,,,insomnia,1632405304,Try and get a prescription for Prazosin from your psychiatrist. It can be highly effective against treating intense nightmares and/or night terrors in people who suffer from PTSD.
4,hdypirx,,,insomnia,1632405042,"yeah i have tried everything, it just sucks because I used to be such a healthy sleeper and this past week feels like a lifetime of no sleep. Hoping it just goes away. I lay in bed all night trying to sleep, the minute i close my eyes my anxiety makes me hot and sweat therefore making going to sleep difficult. Thanks for the info man."
5,hdyon9f,,,insomnia,1632404647,"Shifting schedules is hard. It can help to get bright light exposure in the morning from the sun (or a SAD lamp). The key is to get up in the morning at a consistent time and limit total time in bed. If you haven't shifted yet, don't try going to bed ""early"", you'll have insufficient sleep pressure.

6,hdylbzc,,,insomnia,1632403094,"When do you get in and out of bed?

&gt; when should a person stop eating before bed, even if it’s a small meal/snack?

Different perspectives on this, but it can lead to digestive issues and keep you awake. You can get all the protein you need at dinner."

10,hdyj045,,,insomnia,1632401918,"I have memory issues, cognitive problems and sometimes issues with balance from insomnia. Sleep deprivation screws with you in a lot of ways. But I understand that fear. Being very tired hypes up your anxiety and you start thinking there’s something very wrong with you especially because sleep should be such a normal thing. So if you can’t sleep there must be something wrong. Melatonin can also cause balance issues. I get desperate last year and took a massive dose and I was so dizzy and off the next day."
11,hdyigd5,,,insomnia,1632401632,Sometimes I have luck with familiar tv or YouTube videos. Something I’ve watched many times before that I can zone out to for 20 minutes.
12,hdyi3tt,,,insomnia,1632401450,Can you afford to see a psychiatrist? There are some interesting alternatives to Benzos that can be used for nightmares. Mine put me on something that’s also an anti-histamine that he said he gave to a patient with severe PTSD to stop him from waking up constantly from nightmares. I don’t suffer from severe nightmares so it didn’t work for me but it might work for you.
13,hdygiiy,,,insomnia,1632400595,Oh mine is pretty disabling at this point. I constantly have brain fog and feel like I’m floating but it’s not vertigo. I sometimes even get brain zaps. I can’t concentrate I’m way slower. It’s ridiculous

18,hdyapsb,,,insomnia,1632397100,Yes been like that for years and I’m im on 2 benzos but medication is against me
19,hdy9hmt,,,insomnia,1632396276,Accepting it XD. I've been for 5 months with that s\*\*\*t it's not really disabling it's just that it removed the joy from everything I'd say.
20,hdy8tnk,,,insomnia,1632395820,"It’s common to last this long? If you don’t mind me asking, what helped with your insomnia?"
21,hdy89c1,,,insomnia,1632395416,"I get the initial reaction of fear, I have been there at its worst, after 4 days with no sleep it feels like your world is crumbling, you are dying etc. However 5 minutes reading what fatal insomnia is and it's clear that it's nothing like chronic insomnia and they don't have it, it's one of the rarest illnesses in the world. Insomnia can and has been cured. Not everyone will be so lucky but it can be treated."
22,hdy7mlr,,,insomnia,1632394959,For the future - Exercising will tire you out and help you sleep.
23,hdy7bb4,,,insomnia,1632394724,Is almost every night like that for you?
24,hdy6z1d,,,insomnia,1632394471,It's a common side withdrawal side effect. It happened to me after withdrawing from benzos.
25,hdy6lo0,,,insomnia,1632394191,"I had that last night, tried to go to sleep, kept waking up every hour lolw

Fuck this disorder"
26,hdy6itn,,,insomnia,1632394132,"Actually that's a normal reaction. I thought the same thing. Slept every day for 30 years fine, never had an issue and then all of a sudden stopped sleeping for 5 days in a row. It was the end of the world for me, it's like getting hit by a bus and becoming disabled for lifetime.

Of-course you assume the worst because you've experienced something insane. I don't blame those people thinking of that."
27,hdy687z,,,insomnia,1632393902,am on the sameboat sometimes hah
28,hdy5380,,,insomnia,1632392998,"A couple times in a week I do manage to fall asleep in the middle of night -- I find myself thinking the same thing! 

The feeling of being totally relaxed, hardly thinking anything, knowing you're a couple seconds from slumber. I miss it 😢 People who are able to sleep normally take it for granted."
29,hdy4jyo,,,insomnia,1632392565,Get a friend to sleep with you
30,hdy3jlk,,,insomnia,1632391721,"Have never heard of this, might be as well. Reading up on it online seems that I just have to change my sleep schedule, which seems easy and hard at the same time. Worth trying out. Thanks"

was dealing with one the other day that has now diagnosed themselves with semi fatal sporadic insomnia. Which now exists, because they have named it themselves and diagnosed it themselves."
37,hdy22vh,,,insomnia,1632390432,"I don’t have the money to pick them up at the moment, so I decided to just tough it out until the new appointment date comes and I have more money. In retrospect, I should not have let this happen."
38,hdy1ukt,,,insomnia,1632390220,Why can’t you call your doctor and have them he meds filled? It’s not safe to stop a lot of drugs cold turkey.
39,hdy1n0n,,,insomnia,1632390025,"Yes. I have a psychiatrist who prescribes me medication. But I missed the last appointment, so I had to go two weeks without my prescriptions. I honestly didn’t remember how bad things were without it. I’ll be ok though. My boss will just be annoyed because I’m so slow to deliver work. I just have to make it through until next week, things will turn around."
40,hdy1cj1,,,insomnia,1632389753,I hope you didn’t take 13 Benadryl. It sounds like you could be suffering a serious depression episode. Do you have a therapist you can call or just someone to talk to?

43,hdy0mdf,,,insomnia,1632389083,I can’t count how many times I have reassured someone from not having ffi and sfi.

I also took dyphenhydramine as my emergency pill or once I wanted to take a rest from melatonin. Hope you get a good sleep."
45,hdxzvm0,,,insomnia,1632388388,"That's fine, as long as you're able to go back to sleep. Waking up a couple of times during the night is natural, even for normies."
46,hdxzmwf,,,insomnia,1632388154,I’m moving to hydroxyzine because it won’t cause a dependance like clonazepam(I mean not as much)
47,hdxzkb9,,,insomnia,1632388084,"Thank you for your answer, I meant how I can taper down clonazepam because I’m worried about it. But I’ll be the first to admit that the question wasn’t even close to being clear"
48,hdxzgeg,,,insomnia,1632387981,Yes I have to swap because I get pretty brutal withdrawals if I take benzos for a bit longer. I ended up talking only hydroxizine yesterday and it was fine. I’ll ask my Doctor what to do for today
49,hdxxlc8,,,insomnia,1632386200,"Do you know what caused it?
I cannot imagine the frustration you re going to. Do you see any changes in those 14 months in terms of your physical health"
50,hdxudb4,,,insomnia,1632383189,Take some NyQuil and melatonin.
51,hdxsl60,,,insomnia,1632381598,I am always waking up once or twice though. This was the case even when I was on 5.5 hours of bed time (now I'm on 6.5).
52,hdxshkr,,,insomnia,1632381514,yea
53,hdxsb1y,,,insomnia,1632381358,it sounds like you might have a delayed sleep phase disorder.
54,hdxs2wc,,,insomnia,1632381159,Seems good for insomnia but on a very low dose. How much you take?
55,hdxrqf6,,,insomnia,1632380866,I know what you are saying sometimes I feel like waking my wife or kids up because I am lonely. I think there is a subreddit called casual conversation? That may help.
56,hdxpnzb,,,insomnia,1632379179,A light blanket and YouTube usually does it. But it’s starting to not work anymore. Idk what noises are soothing to you but something about lets play videos make me sleepy
57,hdxpjuh,,,insomnia,1632379086,"Yes underlying stress and anxiety can cause them. Also certain medications, change of sleep schedule, sleep deprivation etc. can also cause them. It is tough, I am also dealing with the jerks at the moment after they started after my panic attacks etc. I was running away from them with sleep meds and stuff but decided to face them head on and not keep running away. It has been tough, especially cause of my fear of them. But you have to let them be and do their things. Maybe you just have them extra tonight because you are thinking about getting enough sleep so that you can do your presentation. Which is making them worse because of your efforts of falling asleep and not wanting them to be here. 

You have to essentially let them do their thing and accept that you might get bad sleep or even no sleep at all - and be okay with that and keep going with it with your daily life. So try to accept the jerks as much as you can, when you feel anxious and frustrated with them, also accept that and observe that you’re feeling this way without getting swept away with the thoughts, worries and frustration. Good luck! Don’t make a big deal out of them even though I know how frustrating it is. Just lay in your bed and rest, don’t fight and try hard to sleep, it will only make it a battle even more and make the jerks more. But you will ALWAYS sleep eventually."
58,hdxpbf4,,,insomnia,1632378901,Currently. I have to be up in 2hrs and I’m trying not to get mad at that thought but I’ve been wanting to sleep since 11pm

64,hdxjhee,,,insomnia,1632374523,"I was fasting yesterday, which raised my cortisol (i'm doing a 40 hour water fast + ice bath every 2 weeks). Eventually I had some sunflower seeds and a protein shake before bed, but still took me about an hour to fall asleep. Then I woke up at around 3 AM to pee, and had a bit of anxiety so I decided to take some magnesium and a pill which has tribullus, ashwagandha and passiflora (called Testogen Max), which fortunately made me sleep until 6 AM.

74,hdxbix6,,,insomnia,1632369464,Sorry 3am is probably the worst time to be up. It's when everyone else is sleeping so we think. It's midnight were I am but I know I'll probably spend all night up. Usually it's not because of any reason but tonight it's because my partner cut down all the privacy shrubs down around our backyard w/o asking me. Now I can see into all my neighbors yards and I'm filled with adrenaline. Not good for restful thoughts. He also had a tree removal service chop down 2 trees so I'm really pissed off. I have a full day a work tomorrow but can't imagine ever falling asleep now. Ugh!
75,hdxai21,,,insomnia,1632368890,"Benzos almost never put me to sleep, even though my insomnia is caused by anxiety. Mirtazapine works well, you should try it. Trazodone is a similar med that worked too well. I was passed out cold with all the lights still on within minutes, the hangover was too much though."
76,hdx9f80,,,insomnia,1632368286,What if you have FFI
77,hdx7jc9,,,insomnia,1632367270,"I don't know if you have a job or are a student, but either way you're probably already on a strict sleep schedule. However, the problem is you can't sleep because you are afflicted with insomnia. See your doctor about using a medication temporarily to reset your sleep so you are sleeping when you need to be. The modern sleep meds are safe and effective. Just be sure to inform your doctor that you just want to use a med for a short period of time. Modern meds are the most direct route to address insomnia issues. Also, try to get lots of sunshine during the day as this will help with changing your circadian rhythm."
78,hdx6p3e,,,insomnia,1632366822,"If you are only taking Clonazepam for less than 2 weeks, tapering isn't necessary. You can just cold turkey on it. I did CT for 3.5 weeks of 0.5mg and dodged a bullet in terms of withdrawal. 0.25 is a very low dose already.

Also, why are you moving to Hydroxyzine? To taper from Clonazepam?

Antihistamines will work well but you will build tolerance with it sooner than later."
79,hdx6mk8,,,insomnia,1632366785,"Yeah, I know it's dangerous, but I limit myself to 3 drinks maximum.

And I've only tried marijuana a few times and it didn't really chill me out, it made me kind of anxious. Granted I have very limited experience with it but I don't think it's for me."
80,hdx61xg,,,insomnia,1632366482,"I understand your frustration. However, the killer wildcard in that combo is taking the meds with alcohol. When someone dies from meds it's very often due to the effect that alcohol has on a particular med. I know you are experienced with meds and probably alcohol too but mixing meds with alcohol is always a dangerous thing even if you've safely done so in the past.

It always amazes me how society will ban all kinds of drugs yet give the most destructive drug of all, alcohol, a pass. Well, at least in the USA they've finally come to their senses in regard to marijuana. It's now legal in many states as it should be. There's absolutely nothing bad about marijuana especially compared to alcohol. A lot of people on this forum use marijuana to treat their insomnia. Have you ever tried marijuana for your insomnia?"
81,hdx5oxt,,,insomnia,1632366296,No problem! Get well sooon. I have asthma so when i had covid I literally kept passing out from being out of breath lol

83,hdx4unk,,,insomnia,1632365864,I had a bad experience with Seroquel. It never worked the first time I tried it. My panic went through the roof because of it. I was up the whole night. My mother and sister had to sleep beside me just because this. My psychiatrist was puzzled why it did not work. She changed the med to Olanzapine and it worked almost immediately.

Have you bothered to look into these, clearly not. 

These do not mention sleep hygiene and one of them performs lab tests to detect any hormonal deficiency that can cause insomnia. So research does exist, you haven't bothered to look for specialists. 

You cannot claim to have a disease that does not exist. You also cannot claim to have the worst case of insomnia in history, that's ridiculous.

I live in Malaysia. Even when I lived in the US, doctors there still know nothing about insomnia. 

If insomnia research as been done, which it has not, medical literature would specifically say that sleep hygiene and exercise have no effect on reducing chronic severe insomnia symptoms. Many medical workers think screen time is a culprit but can't give a shred of evidence to prove it. Every ""research"" article I've read seems fake. They literally copy each other word for word. 

I have one of the worst cases on insomnia in world history. I have to make this diagnosis myself because one one else out there can. My insomnia fits the bill of sporadic semi-fatal perfectly. Medical literature literally has not documented a case of insomnia like mine."

Yes any doctor that recommends sleep hygiene or exercise as a cure is an idiot. I said that it's not a cure by itself. Research is varied and done by people of various ability, so just because some research saying it works doesn't mean all insomnia research is useless. Not all insomnia research claims sleep hygiene alone is a cure. 

Where do you live? What country, area? I guarantee you that there are experts in your country. I live in the UK and there are a number of sleep clinics and psychiatrists specialising in insomnia.

I do have bad habits; I think my main problem is that I need to get more active, which I'm going to start doing ASAP.

172,hdvpjcq,,,insomnia,1632338119,"Good question.

Although napping for insomniacs is somewhat controversial among sleep experts, I take the position a short under 30 min nap is OK, esp if done in the early afternoon, at least 5-6 hours prior to bedtime.

Timing is a factor for naps.  There's a normal dip in the circadian alerting signal in early afternoon, if you have a morning wake time.  That can make it easier.

You can also deploy relaxation methods like deep breathing once you lay down, and even if you go into just a deeply relaxed state without actual sleep, you still benefit.

Beware the longer naps though -- they'll steal sleep from the following night and tend to worsen the problem."
173,hdvph90,,,insomnia,1632338095,"Google is telling me zopiclone was banned in the US for being similarly addictive to benzos. I ended up taking my full 10mg Saphris and 75mg of Vistaril. I slept from 7pm until 2:30pm today. I'm just going to keep taking the Saphris.

174,hdvp1sx,,,insomnia,1632337919,"Quite the cocktail.  What should be increasingly clear to you is the reason these substances aren't working -- because they're not treating the true underlying basis for your sleep disruption.

That's what you need to ID and address.  Presuming you're seeing a doc for all these meds, that'd be a good start.  Consider asking for a referral to an MD who specializes in sleep if  you're not getting anywhere.

Beware the possibility your true underlying issues may not be medical -- that's common, and one reason why the meds don't work.  Usually some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about the idea of sleep.

For that the standard of care is use of a CBT sleep training system, likely what a sleep doc would suggest."

Then I went to sleep and woke up normally on Monday and then later I noticed I was quite tired and I decided to take a nap so I did. Then I tried and I couldn't shut my brain off and when closing my eyes some weird feelings happened like (slow-motion or something weird) and I got worried that something happened to my brain or something.

After this, I just decided to get up and forget the nap. Throughout the day I kinda worried that this would persist to nightime and it did.

I also worried a little bit more because I remebered hearing about some disease that made people never sleep.

179,hdvoi9e,,,insomnia,1632337697,"If there has been any research done about insomnia, why are sleep hygiene and exercise touted as cures to insomnia? Any research that can't deduce something as obvious as this is fake. Anyone who thinks sleep hygiene and exercise can cure severe chronic primary insomnia, let alone sporadic-semi fatal insomnia, is a moron.

Every doctor I've ever been to knows nothing about insomnia. There are no insomnia specialists out there a far as I know. If there are, please give me their contact details right now. Sleep hygiene and exercise are not a cure by themselves. They are not a cure at all. They are 100% useless. Sleep hygiene is not more effective against insomnia than it is against cancer. If sleep hygiene had any efficacy, no one would need sleeping medication. I have literally tried sleep hygiene thousands of times and it has not worked once. I suspect the same is true for the majority of people in this sub. Exercise is equally useless. I have tried that hundreds of times and it has not worked once. I am living proof that sleep hygiene and exercise are completely useless in treating insomnia.

My physical health has never been an issue. I was born with insomnia, so even if my mental health was perfect, it would probably not make a difference. You just don't understand how severe my insomnia is. My insomnia is as severe as cancer. That is why I call it semi-fatal insomnia."
180,hdvo5lk,,,insomnia,1632337552,All of us do to some extent.  Awakening to some degree after each completed sleep cycle is normal.  We experience 4 to 6 of such cycles each night.  Getting that last one completed with a nice REM stage is the ultimate goal.

I have been diagnosed with chronic severe insomnia, which fatal insomnia falls under but that diagnose is not specific enough. The most important thing to know about insomnia is that no one knows anything about it. It is a mystery illness that has never been researched. 

Most pills literally don't work on me. It is safe to say that what I have is very similar to sporadic fatal insomnia. I call it sporadic semi-fatal insomnia. It is a bit less mild than fully fatal insomnia but still so severe that even doctors can't comprehend how severe it is."
187,hdvm4op,,,insomnia,1632336744,"you don't have fatal insomnia, you are freaking the hell out of yourself. you probably have chronic insomnia. FATAL insomnia is so damn different from what you are having. trust me.

want to read some symptoms of REAL fatal insomnia? yes? ok: ataxia, rapidly progressing dementia, cognitive decline, failure to make out words which means you cannot type on a computer or phone, severe muscle twitching and soreness, hypnagogic jerks every time you try to sleep. twitching during sleep, not being able to read properly (dyslexia), extreme confusion and the last symptom; never ending hypnagogia, the sense of feeling half asleep and half awake

here is why you DONT have it: you're able to type on a computer, you don't have dementia, you don't have never ending hypnagogia. you are falling asleep with pills, you are freaking yourself out and you are able to be aware of what you are feeling (by being able to type it out here).

Yes GP's/doctors tend not to be the best,  that is why I have advised you seek out a proper sleep clinic and mental health professional who is an expert in the subject. 

I have suffered with insomnia for well over a decade, about 15 years.  at it worst I was going 4 days with no sleep, at breaking point. The only thing that initially worked was daily sleep medication, Benzo's and z drugs which is not sustainable. 

 Working with a psychiatrist who specialised in insomnia got me to the point where I do not need daily meds, few times a month now.  This was not a quick fix and was difficult, it took years of hard work with her, the improvement was slow but it worked. 

Sleep hygiene is not a cure by itself, exercise is not a cure by itself, however the body and mind are linked so aspects of these along with the therepy worked. If you have poor sleep hygiene, poor diet and poor general health then you will have poor mental health, this will then make insomnia worse. 

So if you are actually serious about helping yourself then find a sleep clinic and or a psychiatrist who specialises in insomnia treatment."

191,hdvfjj9,,,insomnia,1632334078,"Take a step back, sleep problems are rarely a lone problem, always goes hand in hand with something. Let’s rewind, what’s going on in your life? Has something happened? New job/college? New relationship? Moved? There’s so many things that can result in a sleepless night, or several. You need to learn about it as if it’s a character that’s entered your life, asking why? And then learn about yourself. 
If it’s taking you all night to sleep my advice, don’t go to bed. Stay up, read, clean, take care of yourself. Sleep will come. Try sleeping herbal tablets which can be good, however if you want to have a temporary solution get your self some nytol, which can work if used correctly. Try not to worry, unlearn what you are learning and start again."

193,hdve7mo,,,insomnia,1632333542,"Ah seriously please try not to worry. Jolting is very normal it means your brain is closing shop for the night however the fight or flight may kick in - a normal human response to fear. I have had anxiety around sleep for about a year now, all started the night before I started a new job and the anticipation of the next day kept me well awake. I don’t know what it was but something clicked in my head that night which resulted me in having an anxiety about it happening again.. around sleep, and then comes the learnt behaviours in which the notion of time it’s self gives you grief.. as bed time creeps closer. I was a crap sleeper before the anxiety however never gave it a second thought. After that sleepless night I started to google insomnia and was met with absolute horror stories of “fatal insomnia” etc etc (something that is completely been labelled wrong it’s actually more like a dementia in which sleep disturbance is one of many symptoms, and extraordinarily rare) - This mixed with anxiety just made it far more worse. 

My advice to you is to learn about yourself and not what’s on google. Learn about how long it typically takes for you to fall asleep. How long do you sleep etc. Try to go to bed when your drastically sleepy and get up at the same time daily. When you close your eyes practice breathing deep breaths, actively thinking positively and accept panic when it comes. Your emotions are like the weather they will pass. To overcome you have to actively try there’s no easy hack. To help you I found herbal sleeping tablets to be helpful, also night time relief drops and spray. And remember fear is just a chemical which your brain has released because you have taught your brain to do that! You can unlearn with practice. I have always tried to avoid sleeping tablets however personally I find nytol helpful 1-2 hours before bed. You will be fine."

209,hdurpsr,,,insomnia,1632324424,I’ve had insomnia on and off for about 10 years🥴 I actually slept the best during my pregnancy because I was so tired working while being pregnant. I still had some tough nights though. Both my babies and pregnancies were fine. It’s post partum where I’m struggling with insomnia again ( I’m almost 3 months pp)😔
210,hdur8to,,,insomnia,1632324232,"Honestly, it's all about perspective. When you have insomnia, after a while it's not just sleeplessness but you actually de-learn sleep. I did research about insomnia and learning things like sleep hygiene or sleep restriction.

Of course, literally nothing worked for 3.5 years. Whenever I have bouts of insomnia again, I can confidently string together a quick plan in my mind to fix it. I also have a bunch of clever ways to create sleep associations.

If you were to put current me in the shoes of my prime insomnia, I highly doubt I would be able to fix it though.

Everyone's time will one day come, there is no rush. That said, by far the most important step in overcoming chronic insomnia is stopping your extreme desire to sleep. Don't feel irritated about insomnia, don't get worked up. Similarly, don't hype yourself up or be hopeful. Simply exist in the present. Try sleep for at least 25 mins, if it doesn't work then get up and do something light as usual. Enjoy your extra time in the night and never blame yourself. For me, my insomnia was really psychological"
211,hdur30f,,,insomnia,1632324166,"What you're describing sounds like restless leg syndrome. OTC sleep aids often contain antihistamines, which can make you sleepy but are known to exacerbate rls. The rls also may be leading to your insomnia in the first place."

221,hduapx8,,,insomnia,1632317013,"Nothing is known about primary insomnia. No one knows what causes it or how to cure it. No prognosis is given for severe chronic insomnia. Almost every insomnia article suggests things like exercise, sleep hygiene, limiting screen time, sleep restriction, etc, yet, as we all know, none of them work on chronic insomnia. That proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that there has never been any research done on insomnia. Doctors know nothing about it either. If you research insomnia, THE FIRST thing you will see is that sleep hygiene is completely useless. We're literally in the stone age when it comes to insomnia here.  

The articles that suggest things like sleep hygiene are literally the equivalent of an astronomy article that says the Earth is flat, or a history book that says the world is 6000 years old. The fact that millions of people, such as us, are dependent on sleep medication proves that sleep hygiene and exercise are useless in treating insomnia."

227,hdtwsk0,,,insomnia,1632308933,"thanks for being open and sharing, just be aware that alcohol can be used as a crutch but your resistance to the affects grow, so you must in the end drink more and more which is as you mentioned not very healthy, not to mention the sleep you get with alcohol is of way lower quality.

if i might suggest the things that word for me, was various exercises which if not explained well seem to lack luster.

but i decided i had to make changes or i would go deeper into a depression there was no way out of.

so i started with my mindset in a gentle form, just thinking of three things every day and night, as i put my head to the pillow and when waking up that i was grateful for.

10 minutes of calm meditation in the morning and evening

exercising in what ever form be it yoga or running / weights

hot showers in the evening as well as using lavender scented shampoo and candles(aromatherapy)

cleaning up my bedroom so i felt really good about actually going in there

reading for an hour before sleeping, breathing as a response to stress and saying thankyou to thoughts as they entered my mind during this time.

when switching lights out (this was a hidden gem) and after being grateful i started to focus on creating my own world and story and going into great detail to the creation of that universe, whether its sci fi, fantasy fiction or political arena etc ( don't go into horror or dark subjects this wont help at all) the reason this is powerful is because you cant actively think about more than one think at one time, you might have errant thoughts that you say thank you too and let go too  but on the whole you don't think up the feelings of depression and anxiety your usually focusing on being the hero of your story and is much more positive into to mention it becomes quite tiring over a long period of time which also helps.

I am trying to get pregnant and is recently an insomniac (4 months). I worry about this as well. I was able to talk to one fellow insomniac here who got pregnant and gave birth 5 years ago. She was already an insomniac for 12 years. She stopped taking the meds when she was pregnant and the baby was fine. She said it was easier for her during pregnancy in terms of sleep but it came on full force when she gave birth.

231,hdtu9vv,,,insomnia,1632306991,"well marijuana is like alcohol in that it at first can be used as a crutch to sleep at first but you build a resistance to it and using it actually gives you poorer quality of sleep anyway, forgive the curve ball but have you tried anything natural like meditation etc to calm yourself before sleeping?"

I fear something bad will physically happen to me, and when I try to relax and let go I suddenly  feel my heart beating fast and I go to full alert mode, irrational fears of never being able to sleep again or having a heart failure or something because of exhaustion overcome me, almost to the point of a panic attack. It usually takes me at least 1 hour and a half to 2 to fall asleep if not more, although I'm completely drained of sleep and exhausted. However skipping a night's  sleep makes me extremely paranoid, so I think this is a side-effect of the paranoia for me."

Hey man. 

Firstly, you already are on a lot of meds so dont try to just change your doses or take over the counter stuff. 

I’d suggest talking to your doctor about zopiclone or zolpidem maybe? Those are « popular » ones for insomnia at the moment. I personnaly use zopiclone, it tastes like shit but at least I sleep fine. 

Lithium is hard to stabilize and a lot of meds can interact with it so that might me why your doctor has not prescribed those yet.

252,hdt52oq,,,insomnia,1632285790,"alright, ive read enough and i think you should just be straight with her. Tell her you have ""had the thought"" of looking where to buy online, but were scared for obvious reasons. You should not have to resort to that, you have a doctor and she will see this. Now, she has a point, zopiclone is something to be taken for a few months max. BUT At your age and in your situation...your not asking for oxycontin for petes sake and its a low dose...as long as you dont come in 6 months later saying it doesnt work anymore i dont see the problem. (thats tolerance and drug seeking behaviour that will set off alarms).

I think if you just talk to your doctor again and outline how it helps you and maybe mention some of the points ive mentioned and you should be fine. Dont mess around with internet pills."

Your description sounds like what (hundreds of) millions of people have suffered with the pandemic, an increase in anxiety leading to a decrease in good sleep.

270,hdsmb40,,,insomnia,1632275569,"I have this too. Do you see anyone like a therapist for your anxiety? This is a pretty common form of anxiety that results in fear about sleeping and potentially dying in your sleep. 

I am a therapist, but I also struggle with anxiety so I see a therapist! There's some really great ways therapy can help with this and it also might be worth having a conversation with someone about anxiety meds. Sometimes while you're working on an issue like anxiety meds can be helpful even if they are only short term. 

There's a kind of therapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that is really effective for anxiety. One of the things that has been effective for me is to replay a movie or a TV show in my head so that I'm distracted while trying to fall asleep. I generally fall asleep without realizing it because I am thinking about the show or movie.

279,hdsdtlm,,,insomnia,1632271535,"I've definitely had that happen. Haha I once had this weird ""dream"" where I was burning in hell and if I fell asleep it would come true. Totally impossible, yet my mind threw out all logic and jolted me awake whenever I felt myself losing consciousness. Pretty sure I just told myself over and over it wasn't real. I eventually fell asleep and woke up a bunch of times that night, but hey eventually I forgot about that dream. 

Guided meditation can help, it gives you something to focus on."

289,hds1dx3,,,insomnia,1632265623,"I had exactly the same thought. Insomnia is so very debilitating. Arguably as bad as the silent killers: hypertension and diabetes. No one says that blood pressure lowering meds are addicting. You are usually on them forever. 

In the past few days there were a few posts about Ambien and how bad it is. So I thought to myself maybe I should see if I can try without. I’ve been on a low dose 10 mg for several months. I’ve made many lifestyle changes including better sleep prep, lost weight, hormone therapy, meditation, fasting. All that good stuff. Last night was the first night. I slept like shit. Meditated. Started to fall asleep, woke myself up. Tossed and turned for an hour. Fell asleep, woke up every half hour ( I used the pillow app so it confirmed the waking). I will give it another couple of nights as an experiment. But honestly the full four hours straight I usually get with a half tab on ambien may be worth it for the rest of my life. Am I addicted? I don’t think so. I don’t have the shakes. I don’t feel withdrawal. I feel like shit because I had an interrupted total of two hours of sleep."
290,hdryxyt,,,insomnia,1632264469,"Well I was on a high dose of Zopiclone and Citalopram for around 9 months or so but I hated it and haven't taken them in years. I found the side effects outweighed the positives and I still didn't feel like I was getting good restful sleep.

I would much rather take natural remedies than any other medications tbh but it's getting to the point where I will have to try something new. I appreciate all your advice"
291,hdrylwa,,,insomnia,1632264311,"Hmm, if you know that a physical condition is waking you up, it's possible that no sleep med is strong enough to completely override that, but maybe ask your doc what they think. 

Unrelatedly, 30 mg mirtazapine is very high if they're prescribing it for sleep. My psychiatrist said it works better for sleep at 15 mg and below. We were talking about it because I was asking him if 7.5 mg knocks me out, then how can someone taking 45 mg for depression ever wake up in the morning. You could try cutting the pill in half to see if that makes any difference for you."
292,hdrv6vm,,,insomnia,1632262728,"Wish I could help, but I'm in the exact same boat as you.

There are other sleep meds, but in my 20 years of experience, they all do more harm than good if used regularly.

The better way out is to figure out what is causing your sleep issues and address that. Easier said than done, but worth investigating."
293,hdrtrre,,,insomnia,1632262077,I would look into delta 8. It’s helped me calm down and be able to relax and fall asleep on hard days.
294,hdrsiwt,,,insomnia,1632261512,if it becomes unbearable then of-course medication. Although I think medication should be  halted from time to time.
295,hdrsfsl,,,insomnia,1632261473,"I'm surprised. Zopiclone most doctors avoid for the addictive properties of it.  


I've ran the gambit of different antidepressant medication that had sleepiness side effects, did nothing. Except one medication made me realize I was SSRE deficient.   


Zopiclone I have taken for maybe 16 years. I was taking up to 3 pills at one point, then dropped down to 1. Eventually I stopped and struggled with sleep for 3-4 months. Finally deciding to go back on the medication taking half to 1 pill a night, because it was more worth while to do this then it was to sleep. 

If you can find CBN, this is something worth trying, but before you consume it you HAVE to be in bed. I made the mistake of not being in bed and trying to fall asleep when I took it. Kicked in, my body fought through it, and then I developed a tolerance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something that was mentioned earlier this year by a few people was they discovered the were deficient on some vitamins, after taking supplements this seemed to improve their sleep as well."
296,hdrsacp,,,insomnia,1632261406,"That's normal, I was obsessed about it as well. When you know something is wrong and that something is coming at you everyday then you become worried. This additionally creates more anxiety.   
I went through this stage and had a ""scar"" in my chest because of the panic of thinking I'll die. Literally anxiety rose like never before. 

After some time you get to the acceptance phase where the anxiety is gone and you just live with your condition (if it persists of-course).  
The young you to whom you're referring to is dead. I had the same thinking. I could do drugs, study all night, bing drink, have dozen activities and sleep whenever I wanted to, shut my eyes and wake up when I wake up. 

Never thought about sleep it was like drinking water, you re thirsty and you drink you do not contemplate the amount you drink.

You'll will eventually calm down and find you way out."
297,hdroni3,,,insomnia,1632259799,"I can only offer you advice that worked for me, I don't want to sell it as an universal solution because insomnia is hell and it's different for everybody suffering from it but this is what worked for me: Audiobooks. I have selection of about 30 books on my phone that I know well. Some of them have a story, most of them don't, like books about Astrophysics, Biology or History. I haven't fell asleep in the past few years without listening to something. The main reason I can't sleep is overthinking, I just can't be left alone with my own thoughts, they are attacking me, hurting me and keeping me from my well deserved rest. Self doubt, replaying past situations in my head, thinking what others might think about me, thinking about all the things I've done wrong. Having an audatory input I can concentrate on helps me to free my mind, don't think about myself or my problems and fears. It's important to choose books that don't trigger too much emotional response. I sometimes like to focus just on the tone of the narrators voice, the pronounciation or about something relating to the book that just leads my mind somewhere else. I always set the timer to 15 minutes, after that the book starts fading out if I don't tap my fingers on the display (Smart Audiobook Player on Android). I had sleepless nights where I just listened to 8 hours of lectures about astrophysics. But nowdays I can mostly make it to sleep in the first 15-30 minutes and then just reopen the app, rewind it a bit and keep listening when I wake up during the night. Maybe it might help you as well, if not, medical advice is always a good way to go. Keep strong, even the worst crisis doesn't last forever!"
298,hdrofxu,,,insomnia,1632259707,"What you're describing is ruminating, it's a very common and very frustrating symptom of depression and anxiety and I'm sure of many other mental illnesses. I'd talk to your parents about getting in to see your family practice doctor or a Psychiatrist to get into therapy and determine if medication might be appropriate. Sleep is important at all ages but there's scientific proof that teenagers really do need more sleep. It's not them being lazy when they sleep until 10am, it's much needed rest. Best of luck to you!"
299,hdrofm1,,,insomnia,1632259704,"I have suffered with insomnia since 18 and remember more days sleep deprived than days fully rested.

During the day, do low energy exertion. I like to go for walks usually or just lounge watch some tv. I would go do low energy errands like getting groceries.

I will take an intermediate 20/30 minute nap on my yoga mat in the afternoon around 1-3 pm.

Getting through the day of insomnia requires as well that the day doesnt repeat. I have a sleep hygiene routine that increases my chances of sleeping mostly 7 hours."

I don't even know what happened as it's been a blur but I think I had some kind of mental breakdown. Acting crazy, constant state of fear and panic, visual and audio hallucinations and I was even struggling to separate dreams from reality. Scary stuff. It's been a wake up call to change my lifestyle and I've been in contact with a drug rehab centre to deal with my problems.

For sleep, many many people are going through it and you'll feel like your going mad but. You can recover, it can be very hard but CBT-I does work, restricted sleep right down then slowly reintroduce. I'm myself just trying to quit zolpidem (Ambien) and the withdrawal is nasty so. Keep the faith, try a different antidepressants if you need and practice CBT-I like a monk and you'll have a good chance.

Worth remembering unlike being drunk you almost certainly are performing better than you think when tired."

307,hdre2an,,,insomnia,1632255316,"have you tried mirtazapine? worked for me. Obviously you have a really complex situation, but that's just the medicaiton that works for me

you are right, relying on benzos is a bad plan sleep definitely gets worse and take a while to improve after stopping them

also some antidepressants can cause insomnia, most ssri's/snris can potentially do that. 

quetiapine is also good for sleep, depending on your medical conditions could be a good option because at higher doses it's an antipsychotic used for bipolar. 

Doctors do mix antipsychotics, but make sure you and them are watching out for for extrapyramidal symptoms like weird muscle movements or feelings that you cant stop moving (akithesia)"

3) I wash the airways with water 
4) I take a nasal spray and I clean my nose more multiple times and I also take an antistaminic afterwards (all suggested by my doctor)

Like i said try hypnosis to sleep and you will reprogram your brain to sleep by itself and who knows maybe oneday you don't need ambien ever again. It will prob take time 6 months + but what other options you have. You could go to a professional hypnosis.

I am going to start doing it again."

Try hypnosis for sleep. It takes time but you are reprogramming your brain to sleep. Also, try to sleep at the same time each night -  you prob know this. Other than that i don't know.

I have been on ambien for 4 years and don't get withdrawals but i have not skipped  more than 2 nights in a row and atm have no i'll effects but common sense tells me i am in trouble and will need to get off them someday and prob have a huge problem.

363,hdq7v7z,,,insomnia,1632238002,"weed actually damages sleep quality just like alcohol so that's defiantly not the crutch you want to get stuck with, not to mention your body would become more and more resistant to it.

I used to have DPSD, Delayed phase sleeping disorder, maybe i still do but I've wiped away the symptoms. i used to sleep from 3/5am and wake up at 12 then it got worse with depression.

my advise is to actually take the time and look at yourself under a magnifine glass to try and resolve your sleep pattern if isn't working for you, especially as your only 22"
364,hdq7gl3,,,insomnia,1632237833,Yeah I know it's so frustrating. All the doctor wants to do is give me Zopiclone but I don't want to take it

366,hdq6aza,,,insomnia,1632237351,"i think once you get onto the trains of meds its hard to get off, i've know alot of people jsut craving sleep wanting a magic pill then having to take more, something different etc over a 10 year period and always leaves them with just as bad sleep as when they started.

consider natural options first, medication should be used as a later option, of course if you think you have something inherently wrong with you go and see a doctor first, many mistakes can be made with self diagnosis.

Are you at uni? there maybe support services there depending on country, facilities etc"
367,hdq5pn4,,,insomnia,1632237103,"heya, sorry about your mum, must be tough, definitely at times.

it's pretty natural to wake up and wanting sugar and snacks its because the brain which usually wants to ""recharge"" with sleep is looking for alternative energy sources such as glucose/sugar its another reason surrounding sleep which contributes to weight gain.

Im sure the emotional reasons also gave you the hankering for food, when did you fall asleep and last eat etc?"

So what I've been thinking lately is in ways to cope and not be super sad and/or angry that I'm sleep deprived when I'm on a few bad days of insomnia. 

If I had an event to go to, like you, I'd probably drink a little bit, which usually helps me get more excited. Another good thing could forcing yourself into interacting, so you'll probably get more alert cause of the need to pay attention to the conversation. If you accept yourself as super tired and stay in a corner or in a sofa you'll probably just accumulate more tiredness and stress. If you get overly tired, go to the bathroom and throw some water in your face.
You already said caffeine doesn't affect, did you try red bull or other energy drinks? As it has different chemicals, it works differently in the brain, so it could affect you more.
Good luck and hope you can enjoy the event."

It's absolutely ridiculous that no one has ever done any research on insomnia. I am a biological anomaly that modern medicine knows nothing about. 

I tried riviotril and mianserin with my seroquel last night and it worked fine, but took around 2 hours to kick in. That's way too long and I need to ask my psychiatrist to see which medication I should increase my dosage of and how much."

381,hdpu0gk,,,insomnia,1632232039,"The severity of my insomnia is among the rarest cases in the world. The fact that medical literature says I will eventually sleep even without sleep medication is proof that a case of insomnia as severe as mine literally has not been documented yet. No doctor can even give me a prognosis of my case.

Doctors know more about sarcomatoid carcinoma (one of the rarest forms of cancer that didn't have a wikipedia page until recently) than insomnia. The proof of this is that a patient who had this, youtuber Peeweetoms, could still get an accurate prognosis of this type of cancer. They can't even do that for semi-fatal insomnia."

Triazolam is a benzo and it was the only thing that would put me to sleep, but I hated the thought of being on benzos long term. Anyways I was hospitalized (again) and they wouldn’t give me triazolam, they would only give me trazadone. And I bitched and complained because trazadone hadn’t worked before… but after 3 night I was a sleeping even better with trazadone. So I have been on trazadone for a month now and only had 1 night where I didn’t sleep

I don't think you understand how severe my insomnia is. My insomnia is not normal insomnia. Even doctors can't comprehend how severe my insomnia is. Many doctors have not seen a case of insomnia like mine.

If I don't take my sleep medication, I will eventually die. That by definition is a type of fatal insomnia, but perhaps not one of the known diagnoses of fatal insomnia. Most sleep medication doesn't work on me, which means that my unknown type of insomnia. I call my insomnia semi-fatal insomnia.

386,hdpq60k,,,insomnia,1632230201,"Caffeine is what would be the obvious answer. But if you are so exhausted to the point where it hurts to even interact with people all day what I would recommend is trying to take some breaks during the event if you can. Go for a walk around the building/block, take some rest time to yourself in your car if you drive, try to find some peace. Come back after you feel like you are well enough to continue the event. If anyone asks why you need a break it's none of their business or you can say that you honestly are exhausted from insomnia and maybe they will understand. I remember my boss at the supermarket I used to work for would let me take short intervals to sit down in the break room because I told him I suffered from insomnia. Hopefully you can find some serenity today."
387,hdppmf2,,,insomnia,1632229932,Caffeine doesn’t affect me what so ever for some reason. I could drink a 300 mg energy drink and I’d still feel the same. I’m also on medication that raises my dopamine and I’m still screwed. I really appreciate you giving me advice tho
388,hdpp4zv,,,insomnia,1632229686,"Coffee and alcohol would be a quick fix, but then you run into the risk of disrupting your sleep further, the next night. Maybe just a sip of coffee before the event and a glass of wine at the event, to take the edge off.

Protein will increase dopamine, so if you can have a s shake also with some aminoacids on top, before, it should make you feel better."

405,hdp8qd0,,,insomnia,1632218927," I don’t think so, I noticed a subtle difference on trazadone right away.  

You can also talk to your doctor about gabapentin and hydroxyzine-pamoate. 

Also, I had really bad experiences with a number of antidepressants, but those were c class of drugs called SSRI’s, which are considered first line for depression treatment.  There’s good chance that’s what you were given, but it’s worth looking up whatever you’ve been prescribed so you have an idea of what doesn’t work. 

Also, I know it’s working for people but I absolutely hated ambien and lunesta. They made me sleep but I’d wake up feeling just as bad as if I hadn’t slept. And I did all kinds of weird things on them. 

Nothing works for everyone, just gotta keep trying until you find something that helps a little."

I got my oil at the dispensary and I’ve been taking it in peanut butter but making gummy bears tomorrow (my husband insisted on another syringe so the recipe will be right so I guess we will have 2 haha.) the funny part is he doesn’t smoke, never has but better at that stuff.

Speaking of which those directions are confusing, it’s easy to tell you know what you are talking about! I’m interested in trying your suggestion but it’s not at the dispensary I go to. 

I would order online but PA has weird rules. Like you can get dry leaf but you can’t use a bowl have to use a Vape (which sucks balls ). I do love the little cheap pens for during the day aka a hybrid.  You also can’t sell edibles or grow your own. 

We are eventually moving to Michigan to be near family hopefully in a few months and it’s recreational. My husband’s uncle does all kinds of processing

420,hdp1435,,,insomnia,1632211633,"I'm going to go on a bit of a FECO rant right now. FECO is full extract cannabis oil.

I don't understand why so many people suck Rick Simpson's dick. That guy doesn't even know that much about cannabis and he teaches people to make ""RSO"" with isopropyl alcohol and doesn't even say that it has to be purged with a vacuum pump to ensure all the isopropyl is removed. He also claims that ""his"" oil(which was around wayyy before he started making it) cured his cancer, but that's purely anecdotal, he has no proof whatsoever. 
Anyway, oil has been made that way since at least the 60's, why people bought into his marketing and started calling it Rick Simpson Oil is beyond me.  Personally I prefer to make my oil with food grade ethanol instead of isopropyl, because you can never be sure that all of he iso has been purged out of the oil. At least if there is some ethanol left you know it isn't harmful.
That being said, I'm a fan of tinctures as opposed to oil, less waste because you can take it sublingually, and it hits you faster. 

What thc/cbd ratio do you take? I find a lot of insomniacs take stuff that is around 1:1, which I don't understand. That's what Cancer patients should take, not insomniacs. What we need are the psychoactive properties of thc, that's what really makes you feel relaxed and sleepy. Cbd counteracts the psychoactive properties of thc, so the higher the cbd, the less relaxed and tired you'll be. 

I legitimately know what I'm talking about. I was a licensed medicinal grower for years. I grew over 2000 plants at a time and I made very good concentrates. With a doctors referral I also made concentrates that were tailored to their patients conditions. My products were sold in numerous medicinal dispensaries in British Columbia in their ""premium"" sections."

I've been on Klonopin for 21 years and for 20 of those it worked great. Now I am going through some health issues and it doesn't work any more--doesn't get me more than maybe 3, or 4 hours if I'm lucky. Doc wants me off it and has set up a taper schedule but it's only a matter of time before total insomnia sets in while I'm tapering. Then what do I do. I'm 70 and already suffering from dizziness and horrible blahs throughout the day--probably some kind of goddamned metabolism thing. Today was the worst.

446,hdopl0q,,,insomnia,1632202092,"BUt I mean how in heck does a blanket help you get to sleep. Jeez, if all it took was a effin blanket to get insomniacs to sleep there wouldn't be any insomniacs in the entire world."
447,hdop2vi,,,insomnia,1632201744,I noticed this too. It has to be taken on an empty stomach for best results.
448,hdooysr,,,insomnia,1632201667,I had severe side effects on all antidepressants haha that's why i want to stick with ambien.
449,hdooufj,,,insomnia,1632201583,"Biggest things I noticed was a significant increase in super deep sleep and ability to get back to sleep, works better than even melatonin (remfresh)."
450,hdoosss,,,insomnia,1632201551,That's right not sleeping at all got me mentally and physically really fucked up. Yeah i just took it for months and with no break. Now i ran out of it since 4-5 days and all i experiemce from withdrawal symptoms is the exact same insomnia i had before taking them and nothing else.
451,hdoo1y9,,,insomnia,1632201026,No but don't the effects take like 4 weeks to kick in? If i wait 4weeks or more i lose my job. lol
452,hdonxoq,,,insomnia,1632200946,I agree Ambien is chemically related to benzos that's why im asking this question. It works with the GABA receptors in the brain just like benzos do but in a quite other way.
453,hdom6it,,,insomnia,1632199787,T.didn't work for me going out the gate. Waste of money.
454,hdom0yc,,,insomnia,1632199690,How in the heck does a blanket help an insomniac get to sleep??????
455,hdols1g,,,insomnia,1632199530,I love how trazodone is the Md's No 1 choice for insomnia because it's not scheduled and they're terrified of getting flagged by the DEA. But T. does work worth a shit to get you to sleep except for a lucky few.
456,hdolf34,,,insomnia,1632199302,I decided not to take it because I’m focusing on school right now .
457,hdokq7u,,,insomnia,1632198869,I'd suggest easing off by 1 mg every week or so. At that dose no telling what it's doing to the brain. It's a hormone. I take 10 mg every night--started with 1 and gradually went up because the lit says the range is 5-10 mg. I wake up like clockwork around 3AM and pop another 2-3 mg. to send me off again. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but I'm always wide awake by 4-ish.
458,hdoib96,,,insomnia,1632197385,Longest I went was 4 days no sleep but I went over six months 2-3hours a night I currently get about 5hrs when I'm lucky and once a week I get 1-2hrs

460,hdo93g1,,,insomnia,1632192448,"Yes I slept perfect then out of no where I started sleeping 5 hours and getting up at 6am with tons of energy and no supplements worked well. I ended up developing a sleep apnea and with weight loss in starting to sleep better. Idk if it’s a good diagnosis but try one of those apps that record you snoring, if you see a lot of snoring or “waves” around the time you wake up, it’s prob an apnea. I also use a weighted blanket which helps a lot"
461,hdo8fac,,,insomnia,1632192131,Never I always crash but anything 5 hours a sleep is a nightmare for me ... I get more mental sluggishness a d anxiety .
462,hdo621s,,,insomnia,1632191032,"I was prescribed that a couple of years ago, but I had to stop taking it because it made me feel like all of the oxygen in the room was being leaked out and I couldn’t get a breath. Rationally I knew I was ok but omg it was terrifying. Did you ever experience any side effects? The psychiatrist told me I’m very sensitive to different medications/SSRIs."
463,hdo5juz,,,insomnia,1632190797,"Insomnia/sleep disorders run in my family and the best advice I can give is to explore alternative options before you have to settle for Ambien (I’ve been on it before and the side effects are awful… hide your keys and phone). My aunt can hardly sleep more than three consecutive hours a night, she’s been on different prescriptions throughout her life and ended up learning too late that the more you take the less potent it becomes. Are you sure you’re just experiencing sleeping problems or could it be a symptom of something else like anxiety or depression? Similarly to you, I stopped taking naps at 1 and it all went downhill from there. But I did get diagnosed with a few different mental illnesses that are currently being treated with medication and my sleeping has gotten much better."
464,hdo39rx,,,insomnia,1632189726,Eating before bed makes sleeping harder for me.
465,hdo2ukg,,,insomnia,1632189529,"Awesome! Thanks for sharing. I’m so happy about you and hearing about your experience makes me feel positive and optimistic about it.

Did you had any health issue due to the 3 hours of sleep time average for those 2 years outside of just feeling tired or maybe headache/lack of focus/feeling like zombie?

I usually get 2 hour of afternoon nap after 3 hours of night sleep. So, technically it will add up to 5 hoursz Not sort of as what I want as it’s in different parts of the day. But, That helps me on the second half of the day. I have tried not napping as well, but that doesn’t affect night sleep time and only make me more tired during 2nd half."

472,hdnwycy,,,insomnia,1632186817,"You pick a time you need to wake up at - you will wake up at this time every day no matter what.  For me that was 5am, even on weekends.  You then work backwards from there.   They generally recommend that you not get in bed until about 5hrs before your wakeup time if you have regular old insomnia.  But given how severe my insomnia was I was allowed only 3hrs in bed.  So I went to bed at 2am and got up at 5am.  After 2-3 days of this it took all the effort I could muster in order to stay awake in the evening (reading, doing mild chores, etc).  But I would crash within seconds of lying down in bed and it was solid deep sleep.  After several days of success at 3hrs in bed I pretty quickly moved up to 4hrs in bed.  With 4hrs of quality sleep I felt like a new man, I wasn't even tired at work and was able to do my normal workouts.  Over a period of weeks I moved up to 5hrs and then 6hrs in 15min increments.  

Eventually when I was getting 6hrs of reliable sleep I stopped SRT because my problem was no longer onset insomnia, it was maintenance insomnia and early morning anxiety.  This was a different beast and required me to solve my life problems but that's another story."
473,hdnwxks,,,insomnia,1632186806,I have taken ambien for 6 years. It’s the most addicting thing ever. I can not sleep without it. Also I notice if I eat dinner late or snack before bed it looses its effectiveness
474,hdnwqd5,,,insomnia,1632186710,"To answer your question, trazodone is an old antidepressant that is mostly used for insomnia nowadays.  I used it for a few years successfully.  There is a short period of worsened rebound insomnia should you ever want to stop taking it (not addictive) , but nothing like what you'd get from a long-term Ambien addiction.  Might be worth trying trazodone first before settling on Ambien to see if it works for you.  It didn't feel as strong as Ambien though."
475,hdnwm0s,,,insomnia,1632186653,"My Dr said ""rebound insomnia"" is just because you had insomnia before so when you stop taking the medicine it comes back.

We both agreed that it's probably not a bad thing to get addicted to a good night's sleep as long as I don't build a tolerance. Compared to the alternative of not sleeping at all and my mental health crumbling.

He said that in his experience it's uncommon for patients to build a tolerance to Ambien and need their dose increased. So far it hasn't happened to me and very occasionally I can sleep without it.

In saying that, if you're already building a tolerance then you probably need to look at other options for medication with your doctor."
476,hdnukv1,,,insomnia,1632185721,And it’s crazy how it’s lights out don’t remember lol I know it’s a good story when we wake up and my husband says “What do you remember about last night??” Ohhh lawd.. what did I do?? 😂
477,hdnuk3y,,,insomnia,1632185711,"So, the way SRT works is - Let’s say I’m usually getting knocked out at 4 AM or 5 AM until then I roll in the bed. The idea for the next night is to stay out of the bed and do some light activity like reading book or staring at the wall until 4 AM or 5 AM and then go to bed? 

Or can you also go to bed at 2 AM if you feel tired enough?"
478,hdnueso,,,insomnia,1632185643,Lol my husband loves these nights. If I don’t eat before bed.. He’s got quite a few videos. I will say they’re funny and have made me cry from laughing so hard.
479,hdntqc1,,,insomnia,1632185335,"I’ve been on it for 12 years. It’s not a mental addiction. I’ve tried to go without it, for weeks even but it just does nothing. Still no sleep on my own outside of twilight naps. It’s the only thing that has worked for me and I don’t feel groggy the next day. I can’t imagine the life I would have to live without it"
480,hdntg4p,,,insomnia,1632185205,Are you taking any SSRI’s by chance?
481,hdnt78i,,,insomnia,1632185088,"Honestly, I am going through this right now at 25-37.5mg if traz. I realized it’s not the medication it’s me the reason I can’t go back to sleep.

Waking after 4 hours is normal, but anxiety keeps me awake. I get out of bed, go pee act normal for 3 min. Go back to bed and I do deepsh breathing. I follow the breath through the soles of my feet and this has been successfully at falling back asleep."
482,hdnsrj8,,,insomnia,1632184886,Be ready to do a bunch of stuff at night you absolutely won’t remember.

484,hdns8d6,,,insomnia,1632184635,"The problem with sleep apnea is that you'll only remember the times it completely wakes you, but in reality it will be messing with your sleep cycles all night long.

485,hdnr7na,,,insomnia,1632184161,"I've taken max strength Ambien CR and never felt any addiction to it but that's probably because it didn't do much for me, same thing with max strength Lunesta."
486,hdnqzup,,,insomnia,1632184059,"It's not good for you in the long run, there are some tenuous links between cholenergic drugs like dox and memory issues and dementia later in life. If you're young you can probably get away with using it occasionally but if you're over 45 I'd say even every few nights would be pushing it, people over 65 simply shouldn't take these kinds of drugs."
487,hdnpaqx,,,insomnia,1632183263,"It's hard to say 100% for sure but if I went downstairs of the couch and laid on my stomach sometimes I'd pass out for a few hours of anxiety ridden sleep, maybe 3hrs.  The little sleep was bad but the crazy anxiety surrounding sleep made it completely non-restorative.   This went on for two years or so before I really committed to SRT and also making life changes to deal with my anxiety and depression.  But the SRT was really the beginning of the end of insomnia for me.  Once I proved to myself I could sleep naturally if I did a few days of SRT it became something in my back pocket I knew I could always pull out if I needed it again.   It's like having  a bottle of spare sleeping pills in you medicine cabinet that you know you can fall back on if you need them."
488,hdnnh8x,,,insomnia,1632182388,It always sucks. Sometimes there  is just no simple fix. Best of luck to you.
489,hdnn7w1,,,insomnia,1632182262,You are so right. I was so jealous of all my roommates for sleeping so good. I did not get sleeping pills till I was 50 years old. It was the first time anything worked. I do not love them they are far from perfect but it does take the edge off and I am not so anxious every night at bed time. I use an edible THC product now for daily use. Not able to travel with it. Then I take my ambien. It works a lot better if I take breaks from it. I also take a magnesium supplement that helps too. Good luck it is a lonely life. Always so tired. Also I put on alot of weight because of the insomnia. Using food to stay awake and it is the biggest side effect weight gain.
490,hdnk5xn,,,insomnia,1632180801,Do you know if you get into deep sleep or REM sleep with mirtazapine?
491,hdnjp42,,,insomnia,1632180578,an unhealthy amount
492,hdnivod,,,insomnia,1632180191,"Thanks for sharing! How much hours per night did you averaged when you had Insomnia? 

I’m concerned if my wrecked sleep schedule of two nights with 3 hours of sleep every week (on average) is going to harm me in anyway soon."
493,hdniva4,,,insomnia,1632180186,"Unsure what this means.  I will say that clinical sleep studies show even the worst insomniacs experience rapid sleep onset after only 24 nonstop hours of wakefulness.  Maybe you mean 36 hours since you slept *well*?

A doc might be your best bet to unravel this."
494,hdnip6j,,,insomnia,1632180105,The fix usually involves setting and keeping a consistent wake time without sleeping in.
495,hdnhw9q,,,insomnia,1632179730,"Personally, i don’t think it’s worth it. There is natural things that help enough to not become dependent or addicted to a benzo or Ambien. It’s super useful to have but taking it everyday for just weeks really fucked my sleep up afterwards"
496,hdnh79e,,,insomnia,1632179404,Have you tried trazadone
497,hdnee94,,,insomnia,1632178108,"I took ambien or generic version for 10+ years until it stopped working.  I knew I would have to quit eventually.  I didnt/dont like being dependent/addicted to any meds.  It has been about 5 years since I stopped and that has been rough.  I still have terrible sleep and it is a problem.  In addition to trying a ton of other meds that didn't help, I have tried CBD, but not much help and Sativa THC/cannabis - and that helps quite a bit, but again, I try not to take too often - its a drug and it does make me groggy next day.  I wish there was a solution to insomnia - I don't think there is.  BTW - ambien is essentially just like a benzo.  I am not a chemist, but if you compare the chemical structures of these drugs, they are almost identical.  Benzos are very bad addictive drugs.  Good luck"
498,hdne0sw,,,insomnia,1632177935,"Yes I have. I’ve stayed up about 3 days before. Seems the longer I stay up, the harder it is to go to sleep."

502,hdnb4od,,,insomnia,1632176593,"Yeah, tolerance is a potential issue as well, especially with z-drugs like ambien. That's another reason why I try to limit my use to about 50%, over a period of a couple of months.

I'll sometimes switch to Benadryl for a few nights, if I've been taking zopiclone longer than I should. It doesn't work nearly as well, but it's better than nothing."

506,hdn94wy,,,insomnia,1632175681,I think im taking it too. If i see others in my age (currently 22) i envy them for how good they can sleep. Insomnia is a bitch man.

508,hdn93xc,,,insomnia,1632175669,"Except for the symptoms like insomnia and many others, you can't tell if you have it without being tested. Sleeping pills mask sleep disordered breathing by taking care of the insomnia without fixing the underlying cause. That's why people have to keep increasing dosage.

509,hdn8y9i,,,insomnia,1632175600,Have you tried marijuana? Works like a charm
510,hdn8osr,,,insomnia,1632175481,I have taking ambien for 15 years also. When they first prescribed it I took it with Ativan. I had to get off the Ativan they will not let me take it anymore not approved for sleep. The Ativan is bad stuff took a month to get off it. Taking a smaller dose fit a month. Full withdrawal stuff the ambien no nothing when I don’t take it no withdrawal symptoms at all. I only take it if I travel. Well that being said I am retired now so I can go and sleep when I want. Like you I have had insomnia all of my life. It is a lonely existence and if I could change anything it would be that. I would not ask to be smart or beautiful or talented. I would ask not to have insomnia.
511,hdn8lw6,,,insomnia,1632175444,"I had to triple my dose three weeks into using Trazodone nightly. In my experience, I built up a tolerance for it VERY fast—so unfortunately it isn’t effective for me. Maybe that’s what’s happening for you too?"
512,hdn7s2m,,,insomnia,1632175069,No but it's not a big deal for me tbh. The real problem is my difficulty to even fall asleep.
513,hdn7c0d,,,insomnia,1632174869,Have you been tested? Treated for it?
514,hdn79bb,,,insomnia,1632174835,"A book called The Insomnia Answer is the best one I've read on the subject.  I recommend it.

Cymbalta doesn't make me tired at all.  I had depression and anxiety and over time it improved that which helped me sleep better.  It did make me wake up quite a bit at night though.  If you aren't suffering from anxiety or depression I don't see what use it would be."

It has some side effects but it's worth it and they go away in time, say a month or 2 like wanting to eat like a dog and some brain fog and drowsiness the next morning.

I would try something like that first before getting hooked on ambien. Also try so meditation before bed and sleep hypnosis, loads on youtube.

If your choice is take ambien for the rest of your life and get decent sleep, or suffer with chronic insomnia and feel horrible for the rest of your life. Well, that's an easy choice for me.

I've taken zopiclone for many years (it's similar to ambien), without issues. But, my insomnia tends to wax and wane, so I don't take it all the time. Around 50% of the time. It works pretty well, and really helps get me through the weeks/months when my insomnia is bad. I don't need it when my insomnia partially goes away. I haven't taken it at all this month, but prior to that, I took it most of the summer.

I think if you took it 100% of the time, you'd eventually develop dependence on it. But, if you need it, that's not too bad."

549,hdmqrl6,,,insomnia,1632167877,"I've been taking 20 mg of Ambien/Zolpidem a night for at least 15 years now.  I wish that I could sleep without it, but I haven't been able to do that for a very long while.  Frankly, I don't mind it because it works and I've found a dosage that works for me.  YMMV.

Oh, yes, I have a very strong physical addiction to Ambien.  There are very definite Post-Acute Withdrawal Symptoms, the worst being ""rebound insomnia"" which can go on for weeks.  I rue the day that my meds get cut off, but my PCP is much younger than me and doesn't seem to be inclined to take away something that has worked for a long time.

So, yeah.  I wish I weren't hooked on this, but not being hooked on this is far worse than the alternative for me.  I think of this less like addiction than I do just simple dependence on medication: I need Ambien/Zolpidem like a Diabetic needs Insulin."
550,hdmqhqx,,,insomnia,1632167764,"Are there any good resources to follow SRT ?   


Also, I see your other comments that you have tried SSRI drugs (Like Zoloft for instance) and it helped you with onset insomnia. How does that really work out of curiosity?  


Did it used to make you drowsy until the point that you can't keep yourself awake or cling with the anxiety for sleep or did it made you calm in a way that no sleep anxiety related thought came to your mind at all ?"
551,hdmpuaa,,,insomnia,1632167497,Yes SRT is sleep restriction therapy.  That's great if your insomnia is primary and not comorbid.   You can try all sorts of OTC stuff but none of that ever worked for me.  The SRT worked in just a few days to help quell my sleep onset anxiety until I was consistently getting 4-5hrs of sleep.  I restricted myself to 3hrs in bed.  The goal is that you begin to reassociate your bed as a restful place.  If you're lying there awake you're just getting anxious and your brain begins to associate your bed with anxiety and fear and then things really spiral.
552,hdmpb01,,,insomnia,1632167279,[removed]
553,hdmo49l,,,insomnia,1632166796,"Fully Agree.  By SRT you mean Sertraline (Zoloft) or Sleep Restriction Therapy? 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the cause of MDD is directly related to the lack of sleep for me. The days I sleep well (For example: I slept 8 hours on average for a week at the start of September), I felt the world is great, and had 0 thoughts about sleep the next day. The onset time was also rather natural.  Before May when these all started, Throughout my life I was sleeping without any worries. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bit scared about Sleep Restriction. Because from what I understand, for Sleep Restriction I need to be fully awake (or doing some activity) until certain time of the night. Right now, even though I'm sleeping at the same time of the night as I would target for Sleep Restriction - I still keep my eyes closed and lay down on the bed throughout or listen to some sleepy-time podcast. Not that it helps much, but I think it definitely helps me prevent to be an absolute zombie and avoids eye dryness. 

&amp;#x200B;

The medicine/cure i was looking for was either something available OTC/Prescribed which can just slow my mind, or drug me down to sleep or remove the thought of ""scared to sleep"" or ""performance anxiety"" completely. But, I agree - that would not solve the root cause as the root cause has to start with me not making it a big deal. (But, I really can't. The days i feel confident that I won't panic. After it gets 3 or 4 am I start to panic regardless of how calm I were in previous hours)."
554,hdmmrsr,,,insomnia,1632166247,"I once stayed awake for 4 days and nights straight. But after i started to hallucinate i knew i have to get some sleep asap.

556,hdmlwpi,,,insomnia,1632165896,"Everyone is different so hard to say but 2 nights a week generally isn't excessive. How long have you been doing this and what dose? 

If you start finding that it stops working or you need to up the dose then you are developing tolerance so would want to take a break from it. 

I have used it for about a decade, not every week but have never developed any dependence or had to increase dose."
557,hdmlitr,,,insomnia,1632165738,"More likely you're awakening not ""because"" of the dreams but because your sleep cycle has ended.  All of us go through these roughly 90 minute cycles each night, between 4 and 6 of them.  

That's when you're awakening, which is a good sign in some ways, because it proves you're getting some quality shut eye.  That's because the REM dream stage normally is preceded by the deeper more important NREM stages.

You'll probably do yourself a big favor to let go the worry about these med issues, and instead let yourself sleep -- and dream -- in peace.  Regardless of the dream content."
558,hdmkzdp,,,insomnia,1632165520,"I'll try.  

First, forget about lucid dreaming and FFI or any of that.  Instead focus more on what's far more likely to happen.  Meaning sleep.  It's at some point unavoidable, you'll get your share no matter how much you worry you won't.  But you can better manage the process.

Be sure you haven't any untreated med or psychiatric issues.  See a doc if you aren't.  You can then use any number of substance free permanent methods to improve sleep.  The best are contained in a CBT sleep training system.  You might ask your doc for a referral to a counselor for that, it could be a permanent solution for you."
559,hdmkix2,,,insomnia,1632165330,"The traz isn't going to address the covid symptoms directly.  When used for sleep, it's more often for stress and anxiety.

The good news in your case is two-fold.  One is you'll now have conferred a natural immunity, which may be stronger and longer lasting than then vaccine.

Second is the mind-body often ramps up sleep when healing from a virus.  In your case you need to focus on rest in whatever form you can get it.  In fact by focusing on rest instead of sleep you might be able to take some of the ""have to"" pressure off yourself.  Doing that alone can sometimes work wonders for stress-induced insomnia."

562,hdmjw30,,,insomnia,1632165068,"This is a great question, and there is a very good answer that many people have used successfully -- use of a CBT sleep training system.  

This is the substance-free standard of care for both primary and secondary insomnia, and enables you to get to these true root issues you describe -- anxiety, and more likely, stress about the idea of sleep.

It also gives you tools to decondition the negative learned association you describe.  

All these tools complement each other and for most represent a permanent solution."
563,hdmjo5i,,,insomnia,1632164977,"Sleep restriction therapy will really help with onset insomnia as it will prove to yourself that you can sleep and you won't have so much performance anxiety.  It also serves as a form of exposure therapy - if you plan for getting only 4hrs of sleep you'll find that it's really not as bad as you've built it up to be and you won't be as anxious about it.  

You do need to actively treat any comorbid depressive or anxiety disorders that might be underlying your insomnia though.  If you're suffering from MDD then SRT will help consolidate your sleep but the problem is less likely to resolve until you get the MDD or anxiety disorder under control."

582,hdm9xnv,,,insomnia,1632160970,"Thanks for your detailed response. Yeah, I think I attribute my daytime tiredness, insomnia and mild depression during the day to the stressing about sleep aka sleep anxiety. 

The days I sleep well, the next days I don’t even think about sleep, or even look at clock and I sleep well (7 hours is optimal time for me). 

But, when I’m in this cycle. As soon as it’s bedtime, The fear about sleep crawls in and I feel pressured to sleep. This anxiety lasts for first few hours where I feel naturally sleepy due to my sleep cycle. Then by the time it’s 1 AM it turns into panic and restlessness until 5 AM where my eyes is forced shut off to sleep due to my body unable to keep up with it. 

And I wake up at 9:30 AM almost everyday regardless of when I sleep because of my cycle. 

I try to take nap in the afternoon (if time permits prior to 2 pm) for 2 hours which helps me get ready for the rest of the day. The day I don’t take nap, I feel dead by evening.

I don’t know how meditation or mindfulness will help. I just want my mind to be shut down or remove the element of “You need to sleep” out which I just can’t seem to let go"

I was going to say something along these lines. I have clinical depression and bipolar II disorder (among other physical and mental conditions) and nobody takes it seriously. I constantly hear things like ""You have nothing to be depressed about"" or ""If you take a walk in the forest, your depression will be instantly cured!"" Condescending bullshit that makes you look like a total asshole. Those who don't have mental illness not only don't understand mental illness, but they can't even empathize with us.

I often slept in until the late afternoon if I wasn't doing anything that day. I was always told how lazy I was and I believed it. Now that I have my diagnosis, I realize that I wasn't lazy. I wasn't breathing while I slept, and I woke up dozens of times every night. I wasn't getting any quality sleep. and I could sleep 15 hours and still be tired. I have lost several jobs because I couldn't wake up and got fired for attendance, and I got kicked out of college for having poor grades because I was failing my classes because I couldn't get out of bed and make it to class. Now, I have a CPAP machine which definitely helps, but only so much. I still have to take Ambien to sleep, because if I don't, I will lie awake in bed for 6 or 7 hours and not be able to fall asleep. Since I have had my breathing machine, I have managed to keep the same job for longer than I ever had a job in my life. I just wish I had been diagnosed when I was 20 instead of in my 40s. My life would be quite different today."

In my case this is caused by anxiety. I go to sleep, i dont fall asleep quickly, then i start to stress about not sleeping and the fact that i will be a mess on the  next day, and i just keep trying to fall asleep as fast as possible. Once 4 am passes i realize that even if i fall asleep now i will be a mess the next day, so i just accept that and stop stressing about sleep, i just accept the fact that i will be tired the next day.

i sleep during the day and just tell people i work online at night. if they ask what i do i tell them random stuff every time. they usually don't know what i'm talking about so it's fine. if they do i'm also not technically lying, they just don't know i'm not actually getting paid most of the time.

i guess that would be hard to do if you're actually living with them tho. i see no issue sleeping late on weekends and they shouldn't either. you get up on time every other day so what's the issue. im sure they would be complaining about you some other way if you were even getting up early tho. people act like insomnia isn't a valid condition or something, it's so irritating."

The thing that's been perhaps hardest to get across to *some* doctors is that when I say I've had this my whole life, I don't mean my adult life or the past 10 years, I actually mean literally *my entire life.* I thought it was completely normal to lay awake for ages before going to sleep until some kid on the playground made a random comment -- and since up until then I'd assumed it was totally normal and happened to everyone, that kinda tells you it's been going on for at least as long as I could remember at age 8. It's just never been something that's not there.

And yet. Seen too many specialists who insist that no one has insomnia from birth and that I'm -- what? lying? terribly mistaken about my childhood memories? simulating? What do they think I'm trying to get out of it that I couldn't just as well do with a story about how it started in grad school? (Seriously, if I were drug-seeking, would I come up with *this* as a story? Hell no, I'd go with ""Yeah, about six months ago this started, I want to get back to normal."" It's like they don't even think that far though.) It's why I really appreciate the doctors who trust me to know what's ""normal"" for my body, who listen to what I'm saying and believe me -- and who, when I don't respond to treatment, ponder why and try something else, as opposed to ""Well it should work. The problem can't be the medication so I guess it's you.""  


&gt;it doesn't help that most of them have never experienced chronic insomnia themselves so they really can't relate.

This is such a good point. They might intellectually get that it's difficult, but that's a whole other world from understanding on a gut level just how much this absolutely screws with your life.

I don't have a therapist. I had numerous therapists over the course of about twenty years and got nothing out of it.

Tried trazodone which is kind of similar to mirtazapine, and it worked to knock me out, but the hangover side effect was way too severe. Benzos kind of work better than nothing, since my insomnia is anxiety related, but not guaranteed by any means. The only other thing that worked sometimes was diphenhydramine (unisom), which was surprising because it's OTC. Not as strong or guaranteed to work as mirtazapine though. It's worth a try!"
710,hdjy2in,,,insomnia,1632111661,"Oh, no no I didn't mean that it's easier or harder. I meant insomnia is widely misunderstood and not taken seriously enough, no matter what other issues you may or may not have.

It depends on how bad your insomnia is, give it an hour to be sure, but it might work for you before that.

Just to warn you- you might feel drowsy the next day. This goes away with regular use."
714,hdjvixj,,,insomnia,1632110148,"The anxiety increases a lot during the early stages of sleep restriction. You just need to follow it to the t and keep going. My window to start was 5 hours and I wasn't allowed to increase it at all for over two months because I hadn't hit the goal they'd set for me yet. Then it was only 5:15 for another month. It's pretty extreme, but it works. The other people on here who have posted that it didn't work admitted that they didn't really follow the rules, they took naps, they stayed in bed for over 30 minutes of waking time, etc.

Re anxiety: you should talk to your therapist, but many times people are not aware consciously of their anxious thoughts. They may only feel the physical symptoms of anxiety. That doesn't mean you don't have anxiety. You can learn to become more aware of the underlying thought patterns in therapy. Most people have insomnia from anxiety and stress. It's pretty rare that you'll have it from a physical problem like sleep apnea, but you can rule it out with a sleep study if you want to."

Like antidepressants though we'd die from lack of sleep before we found the right combination.
726,hdjnd0k,,,insomnia,1632105905,"I also had this attitude until I was awake for three days straight. 

Your body does not always obey"
727,hdjm941,,,insomnia,1632105352,I feel you. But a lot of people recover from this. There is hope.
728,hdjm7rc,,,insomnia,1632105334,For a lucky few it works consistently. For quite a few it doesn't work at all. And for the majority it works for a few nights and then doesn't produce any sleeping effect. The literature states that at most it will work for maybe 1-2 weeks and then lose its effectiveness.
729,hdjly5u,,,insomnia,1632105205,"As someone who had depression at one point and has PTSD, people don't always feel bad and try to help. Everyone thinks I'm being lazy as well. And if I bring up any of my diagnosed issues I get, ""I know you struggle with those things but you've got to figure something out, right?"" or people think I'm using it as an excuse. 

I think people just get tired of feeling bad for me eventually.

I don't think you're lazy. I think just about everything is harder when you can't sleep like most people can. The label of ""being lazy"" downplays the struggles you face and it's unfair. It's not right. 

Whether you seek out medical help or not, I hope you find sleep. Or at least don't have to deal with the ""lazy"" label as often."
730,hdjjt2a,,,insomnia,1632104166,"I'll elaborate a little. I know of at least one insomniac (me) that has no psychological anxieties or negative associations about my bedroom, bed or sleep. When I go to bed, even if I remain awake, I experience no anxiety. I feel calm, relaxed and comfortable in my bed even if I don't sleep. However, by the time morning rolls around, my night of insomnia kicks off anxiety which gets progressively worse as the day goes on. Physically, my brain feels ""tight."" So, my insomnia produces anxiety not from negative psychological thoughts, but from the insomnia itself. However, I have observed that some insomniacs experience being tired or sleepy without anxiety and I knew a guy that actually became more upbeat and comical when he had insomnia. I believe that people that only experience sleepiness, not anxiety, are far more likely to benefit from CBTi providing of course that they only have primary insomnia. CBTi SR should ideally produce increased sleepiness, not anxiety, and this increased sleep pressure would ultimately make it easier for an insomniac with primary insomnia to fall asleep."

732,hdjcy99,,,insomnia,1632100856,"&gt;Most of them are in bed by a time which would allow them sufficient sleep by the time the alarm clock goes off yet they remain insomniacs. So, it seems that specifically for insomniacs, that a consistent sleep schedule does not address their insomnia.

It me. 

I primarily have problems getting to sleep. (If I'm having a lot of stress or anxiety I also have problems staying asleep, but the onset stuff is what really kills me.) This has been a problem ever since I can remember; I vividly recall the day in elementary school where some kid said ""Oh, my head hits the pillow and I fall asleep"" and I was BOGGLED by the notion that this was possible, because it usually took me an hour or more. 

This also means that I had insomnia throughout the time in my life where my schedule was incredibly regimented and involved getting up before 7 am for school (though not on weekends, so I'll admit I did sleep in those days!) *and* exercising daily (usually gym class and team sports). Made not a whit of difference in my sleep. My sleep schedule now is a lot more erratic and that isn't good for my mental health so I'm working on that, but I have to be honest and say that with a lifetime of insomnia experience, a regular schedule just isn't the cure-all that doctors would like it to be.  

So I have pretty significant and pretty intractable insomnia. I've tried most everything that's out there. And yep, I tried the sleep restriction therapy - I did it on my own, and it just did nothing except make me immensely tired. BUT NOT SLEEPY. My current sleep specialist insists that of course it didn't work because I wasn't doing it under the supervision of a professional. Sure, dude, whatever; I'll do it your way and fail again, and then maybe we can talk medication? 

I am almost always tired. And almost never sleepy. 

I've seen some really good doctors about this, including someone who was head of psychiatry at a major clinic and who only ever took on cases he found ""interesting,"" and he was *great* \- insightful, very much listened to me to the point where I would say that ""we decided I should try this"" instead of ""he said I should try this."" He was the one I was most hopeful for, but even he was stumped. 

I found one medication that works for me, but it's an wayyy off-label use - I took it for something else and was shocked to find it made me seriously sleepy! The specialist literally said ""I have never heard of this medication having that effect"" but also said ""You know your body best and if you say it's working and I think it's safe, let's do it."" My current doctor does not feel this way, so I'm jumping through hoops in the hopes that they will eventually agree that this is the only thing that works *for me*. I did find it interesting that apparently this medication functions in my body in a way it does not for other patients, and I don't know if that says anything about my body being weird and screwy. 

I did get sleepy in the evenings when I started effexor, which was *super exciting*, but the effect only lasted two weeks and then my body had acclimated and no matter how we played with dosage we could never get that effect back. Honestly, that was the worst, because for two weeks I realized what life could be like if I could sleep - I've been functioning at about 80% at best most of my life, and all of a sudden I was at 100% and it felt great .... until it stopped being effective, which then sent me into a hell of a depression spiral, because now I knew what I was missing. 

Um... I'm totally rambling now.

Also, I have severe anxiety which both causes my insomnia and is worsened by my insomnia, and sleep restriction therapy helped me a lot. Yes, getting very little sleep in those first months was brutal. I felt like shit and was crying all the time. It still helped eventually."

When my insomnia is bad, I fixate on a single thing. Often, bad memories. Or, sometimes just discomfort of the moment. That's never good for getting to sleep.

When I take zopiclone, I just go to sleep, without thinking about anything. Perhaps that's what normies do."
744,hdiohen,,,insomnia,1632089466,"Okay, good to know meds are working for you. Sometimes, they're the only thing that works. But I suggest trying the other approach first, since it can often help if your condition isn't chronic. Seems in your case, meds are the best choice."

Whenever I'm about to fall asleep a character pops up in my head who is pretty my opposite and is laughing and berating me for my weak personality and life decisions. He wears a top-hat for some reason. He just pops up whenever I'm on the verge of sleeping. Basically I have created a character in my head who constantly mocks me but who seems real. He often does a silly dance while also killing random people in the must gruesome way and mocking me at the same time.

After finally falling asleep, after one hour I was plunged into a crazy but fairly (for a dream) realistic waking dream involving my 2 flatmates. It felt so true and believeable that as soon as I got out of bed the next day I congratulated them for saving me when the aliens broke into our house silently and were telepathically communicating with me to come away with them to their ship, which I was gonna do after they sold it so well. But Jack and William convinced me otherwise and slaughtered them all.

I was so disappointed when I told them thanks for all you did last, you guys saved my life. As I saw their surprised looks, I started recounting their great rescue but halfway through my brain cliked that it was a waking dream. They are another horrible way for the brain to, for some reason, prevent the mind from letting the body sleep when deprived. Jack and William are still, to this day, very confused.

Oh and those twitches you get just before falling asleep is another the way the brain try to tell you to stay awake. Shout out too for the supreme GAD and that feeling of being in that space between life and death. Oh yeah and all those audital and visual hallucinations. It's so fucked."

747,hdiht7n,,,insomnia,1632086551,Maybe try a different form of meditation? In Tai Chi/Qi Gong practice there is something called standing meditation and lying down meditation. The lying down meditation has gentle movements associated with it. That might help.

Do it 7 days a week, or it won't work at all. Set your alarm for 7am, and get up at that time every single day, including weekends. Every day. I repeat: every f\*ing day.

Don't lay in bed, even if you have only slept an hour, or even none at all. Get up at 7am right away, and stay up.

DO NOT NAP during the day... ever.

Your body will eventually cause you to collapse to sleep when you go to bed. It will take time, but eventually your body will be too tired to stay awake at night. It might only result in one night, at first. But, eventually, you'll get a few decent nights.

You probably won't ever be a good sleeper, and will always not have enough sleep to feel rested. But, you will likely get to a point where you get enough sleep to function.

If, after several months of trying that, if you're still not sleeping more than 4 hours during the night, go to a doctor and gets some meds."

Insomnia is just as serious and debilitating as depression not to mention it fuels mental illness, some people will understand, some won't, there's no shame in it.

Ive done that for years since I was a kid and have done it almost every single night since. Sometimes i can't focus on it so I will think of either things I look forward to or things I like doing. Sometimes thinking of hobbies keeps me awake because my brain gets too into it and it gets me pumped up.

When I start thinking bad thoughts I realized that laying there trying to get my mind off it rarely ever works, so I will look at my phone for maybe 10 minutes trying to get refocused on something else until i calm a bit then try again. Sometimes just not thinking about anything and shutting your brain off and focusing on the black under your eyelids helps but rarely do I do it until I am fully asleep, I like the strange thoughts as I am drifting off."

805,hdg2ife,,,insomnia,1632045807," ive been up nearly 24 hours now

my severe insomnia (probably will go another 48 hours without sleep today until i can get my hands on some meds) began with an unexplainable ""air-hunger"" (have had breathing tests, cat scans, x-rays, etc, and no diagnose aside from a pulmonary embolism that actually wasnt the cause) that forced me to figure out how to fall asleep before the sensation of needing oxygen would set in (i would concentrate on an image or something that would get me sleepy for some reason). if i couldnt fall asleep within 8-14 minutes, i would have to get up and catch my breath, and repeat the process. eventually i would get 4-6 hours of broken sleep a night for the past two years this way (almost night was a struggle) but after one night of failing to sleep at all, i have developed severe anxiety that now prevents me from sleeping without any OTC meds (doxylamine). 

i know some people here get annoyed when anyone brings up fatal insomnia, but given that my insomnia is complicated by an undiagnosed air-hunger (it's constant -- i live on yawning every 15 minutes basically), i may actually die of insomnia if meds dont work."

That said, if it helps you sleep and you feel ok the following day, who am I to tell you to stop?

Maybe my one piece of advice would be to reduce your melatonin dose as most of the studies done into melatonin have achieved best results from doses of around 500mcg. 

Aside from that, you can always try to do other forms of self care in an effort to reduce your dosage of all three things over time. 

And that’s all the usual stuff you hear about! Exercise, meditation, therapy etc etc.

Meditation actually really helped me. My mind is more active after I’ve had that six hours and I think having practised meditation for a while, it gives you the ability to ‘loosen your grip’ on your thoughts that can start up.  As a result of that, I’m more likely to fall back asleep.

It's important for me to know because when I'm talking to a neurologist he shouldn't send me back to the psychologist (I already was there and she told me that there is no psychological issue)

834,hdfgr63,,,insomnia,1632029094,"Stress, anxiety, depression can have a big impact and lead to different types of insomnia.

But if those (largely) do not apply, that's very good.

Important: talk to a sleep specialist (do not let a ""normal"" MD dismiss sleep as speciality) to get advice and help. 

That being said, here are ""sleep supporting routine"" and ""sleep hygiene"" things that helped me:

1. waking up at a fixed time in the morning (to adjust sleep drive for the evening)

2. taking a walk shortly post wake up at sunrise (for circadian rhythm re-sync; exposure to specific UV light range from the sun is important here)

3. if you drink coffee or tea, leave at least 8h window (depending on your metabolism) caffeine free before sleep; if consuming any alcohol, leave plenty of time to digest that fully before sleep also (critical)

4. exercise (but leave good 6h+ window before sleep if very intense exercise)

5. prepare and eat meals with your loved ones, talk with them

6. evening walk before sunset (for circadian rhythm re-sync; again specific UV range from sun important here)

7. winding down (work, stress, screens, food) via taking a bath, meditation, reading books, relaxing music, etc. some hours before bed (eg. 2-3h)

8. reducing temperature for sleep (eg. 16-22 C)

9. reducing lights, especially bright blue lights, low level orange lights are better; bedroom needs to be dark

10. your bedroom should be for sleeping (and sex life) only ie. help your brain form association between being in bed and falling/staying asleep

11. aiming to fall asleep around 10 pm, esp. as yawning starts (to optimize for important hormone release window)

12. being very regular about it all

I know some of the above (eg. going to bed early) may be inconvenient. Hard truth: they are important.

Read ""Why we sleep"" by Mathew Walker (unless you have obsessive personality, then perhaps don't).

Listen to Andrew Huberman's podcasts about sleep.

Last thing and most important thing: good quality sleep is critical for your long term physical and mental health, well being, immune system, memory, learning, everything really. Do not neglect it. We tend to take good night's sleep for granted, until we loose it, and then it can get real scary real quick."

836,hdfa7bl,,,insomnia,1632025164,"Life has been stressful past couple of years, but certainly not since this problem started."
837,hdf76yd,,,insomnia,1632023592,"Woah, slow down there, partner. It's doubtful you'll have insomnia forever due to bladder issues. There would still be sleeping medication and I guess some of that stuff would rather make you pee your bed at night than waking up which might be nasty, but hey, at least you'll get some shut eye for 7 hours straight or so and there are those waterproof bed sheets that soak it all up. What I'm saying is you are not as hopeless as you think you are. Remember that insomnia itself makes you feel more hopeless and more miserable in general than you would be normally. I heard of a guy who had to get his bladder surgically removed because of ketamine.

You clearly need to make some changes in your life to improve its overall quality. It sounds like you need a combination of sleeping aids, psychotherapy and bladder medication. I know emotionally you are in a dark place right now. But you are definitely not out of options. Think of it this way: You came to the realization that the ketamine use was a mistake. You have dreams and goals. Those are good qualities to start over.

The next thing you need to do is to get psychological assistance. You can call someone immediately if you feel like things get out of control for you. You can even call the emergency hotline if you don't know who else to call. And when your feeling of depression about this is dealt with, you can look for another doctor who might have better bladder medicine than your current one and if necessary you can get sleeping aids that'll knock you out. Trust me there is some strong stuff out there that of course you shouldn't take long-term, but that will definitely help you break this cycle of insomnia. Sometimes one good night's sleep is enough to make a longer change. 

It's important that you keep it together now. I know it sounds a bit harsh, but you have to snap out of this mindset. Did you hear about breathing exercises? They can help a lot, biologically breathing out relaxes you. Meditation can help too. Stay strong."

I have trouble sleeping. Last week I started a new work. Last friday I couldn't sleep till 6am. I do physical work. I called them to talk about, they didn't pick up the phone and I decided to go anyway. 
I was allright. It's half work half reintegration. (english is not my mother tongue, this is what we call it in dutch). 
It's great place where I feel at ease and where I do what I love, or at least more than I'm used to (e.g. working in a factory, not it for me). 
I'm telling because I think it helps me stick to my plan, and not say: ""oh, I'm tired, so I won't....."" 
So halfway through the morning I confessed my bad sleep to the man of the reintegration place, who is btw a succesfull man in his work, in what he does.   He told me, do come when you are tired. Work your own tempo but show up. After a day's physical work you will be tired and sleep. I just decided to listen for once because my staying at home has not worked out well for me...He also confessed that he himself had night where he falls asleep very late. He decided to not make a big deal out of it. Gets up, reads a newspaper, watches a show, and usually gets back to sleep. I suggest anyone should ask for help when he needs it regarding sleep, but I likes his ease of handling the situation. 
Halfway through the day I had my typical pains somewhere in the chest, that I het when I'm tired but go to work. It lasted half an hour.

I hadn’t hit REM in years.Dr. Barry Krakow studied middle of the night insomniacs, and discovered 90% of participants had sleep apnea. [https://youtu.be/izgtCxsLVd0](https://youtu.be/izgtCxsLVd0)

Get a sleep study if you have insomnia. It could be the answer. Even if you don’t have sleep apnea, it’s better to 1st rule out the possibility, because it’s treatable. Sleep apnea does not just affect older and overweight people. Tiny Amy Pohler has sleep apnea. It's incredibly common."

877,hddfycu,,,insomnia,1631996067,"I had Covid back in October 2020.
Got the first jab of the Moderna Vax on August 24th 2021. About 3 days after the jab I couldn’t sleep. Felt very wired. Almost like having the lights left on in a house. My best analogy lol- I started to worry about lack of sleep since I am big into fitness and need to train every morning. Tried Indica from a dispensary. Nothing. I am prescribed Klonopin for panic attacks but keep them on hand if one were ever to happen. Which hasn’t in many years. Tried .05mg and that worked perfect. It allowed me to quiet the mind and get a restful sleep. Doc suggested to not use the klonopins and prescribed me Trazadone 50mg. which did not work. They say it’s takes a bit to build up in the system. I didn’t want to wait days for it to kick in. I needed my sleep. Anyhow, called doc back and she said just take the Klonopins for the short term until this subsides. They worked for me and we need to treat this quick- 
I notice now, I went from sleepless every night, to every other night and I only to take a klonopin every other night, when the annoying restlessness occurs.
Not sure if that’s because the body is getting back to normal? The doc also told me that the vaccine can cause issues with Estrogen. Which affects sleep, and even for women, their menstrual cycles- which seems to be another side effect that’s unraveling. Hopefully that is normal for me. I’m hoping I’ll eventually get my sleep back to normal- they system just felt revved up. I don’t want to have to stay on K-pins for the long haul. So we shall see…"
878,hdddhj4,,,insomnia,1631995057,This isn't insomnia. It sounds like something is wrong though. The person that suggested sleep apnea may not be far off.
879,hddb8sw,,,insomnia,1631994129,Thanks for sharing
880,hdd8ez3,,,insomnia,1631992958,"Ive been using sleep mask for years, it doesn’t really help with auto-wake up after 6 hours :("
881,hdd6f9e,,,insomnia,1631992144,"I have ADHD and GAD. I've had issues with insomnia in the past and they have become more frequent as I get older. I go to therapy and am working through my issues, but I am a high energy person who used sleep as a coping mechanism, so when I went nights on end sleepless, I was falling apart. No anti anxiety meds work for me, and the Seroquel seems to be the best answer because at least I don't spend all night fretting about sleep.

I am working on my anxiety and I would absolutely love going substance free, which is why I'm trying to keep the meds to a minimum while I train myself to wind down."
882,hdd5h6v,,,insomnia,1631991748,Tried that for two years.
883,hdd4tlj,,,insomnia,1631991466,"Not here to scare anyone intentionally or to give cause for aversion to the medication. I had taken ambien consistently for 2 years and blacked out when I took it and went to bed. Next thing I knew, I was taking a sobriety test and got charged with a DUI. Definitely not something to put out of the realm of possibility."
884,hdd1xt0,,,insomnia,1631990279,"Timing matters - avoid eating 2-3 hours before sleep.  Low low carb where you’re in ketosis will sometimes give ppl more energy, but also reportedly helps even out circadian rhythm and improves sleep… I don’t think any truly definitive studies have been conducted tho…"
885,hdd0bgr,,,insomnia,1631989619,just read the side effects all you’ll see for yourself it’s real unlike these ppl here that don’t know what they’re talking about
886,hdcqz5w,,,insomnia,1631985798,"I promise you. There’s something organically wrong with my brain most days I walk 5-7 miles for exercise and it still doesn’t put me to sleep. I used to nap all the time, and I haven’t tKen a nap since this happened"
887,hdcmzel,,,insomnia,1631984154,i used to take ambien.  the side effects of sleep walking are REAL !  but now i’m taking ambien CR and haven’t had any of those side effects thank goodness.  but i also sleep walk without meds. but worse w the regular ambien.
888,hdckhsc,,,insomnia,1631983121,"The problem is I DO feed the insomnia. I am not a disciplined person at all, I don't manage stress well. In the night I tend to run with the idea that every skipped heart beat means I'm dying, every headache means my braincells are dying. I'm trying to learn how to manage my anxiety, but it's hard to learn when you're so fatigued, ya know?"
889,hdck60t,,,insomnia,1631982987,"Deep abdominal breathing is an excellent way to help induce sleep.  There are many others.

Great respect for accomplishing this substance-free, that's the sustainable and permanent solution."
890,hdcju0s,,,insomnia,1631982852,"You'll do yourself a huge favor by letting go the worry about FSI or any other issue that's highly unlikely to happen.  Much better to focus on what you want, and what's far more likely to happen.  That's part of taking back control.

When the choice is insomnia control you, or you control it, that's an easy choice to make.

See a doc if you haven't already, and if no untreated med issues, consider use of a CBT sleep training system for a comprehensive solution."
891,hdcjix7,,,insomnia,1631982726,"The idea of relaxation is in general very good, if nothing else to help reduce overall levels of stress.

The good news for you is most acute insomnia like you describe generally resolves on its own in under a month, especially if we avoid feeding into the worry about sleep.

Sometimes just letting go the worry is the best thing to do."
892,hdcj6y0,,,insomnia,1631982588,"The fact that you ""don't feel tired"" suggests you're actually sleeping a lot more than you think you are.  Sleep state misperception is very common, and usually part of the problem.

The usual advice is to start with your doc to ensure nothing medical.  If nothing, which is most common, then use of a CBT sleep training system will give you a comprehensive structure for sleep improvement.  Works for most people."
893,hdciz33,,,insomnia,1631982497,"I use a sleep mask. They are every where.



It makes everything in the room pitch black.

It totally takes away the glare of the sun.



It was life changing for me because I moved to a state where I had the same problem as you.


I did not believe it would work. 


Once you put it on? Your body relaxes.


Try this and see if it works for you.

894,hdciwd2,,,insomnia,1631982466,"My first thought is the substances aren't working and could be part of the issue.  If nothing else, there's the possibility they're reinforcing the idea that your solution is external and out of your self-control.

There could be a number of other issues going on, hard to tell from your post.  But your ideas for a relaxing wind-down and sleep hygiene are good.

If you have no untreated med issues causing this, then you might consider using a full CBT sleep training system.  That gives you the hygiene plus many other substance-free methods that all work together.  Could be a permanent substance free solution."
895,hdcirim,,,insomnia,1631982410,Add 45 mins of cardio daily into your routine IN THE MORNING + no naps throughout the day = no insomnia
896,hdci9d9,,,insomnia,1631982199,"See the experience of Randy Gardner for more detail on how we typically recover from acute sleep deprivation.  Usually very rapid and complete, and esp so at your age.

If you feel you have cognitive impairments, this is best discussed with your primary care doc, who may run some tests and refer you to a specialist if necessary.  I suspect that will be unnecessary.

Instead, the more likely explanation is anxiety, which of course seems to run rampant in society these days.  Your post implies you may have some cognitive distortions that are feeding this, meaning you are viewing your situation in an overly negative and unrealistic way.  

To the extent that's true, you may find counseling helpful.  Or, if you're the self-help type, there's quite a bit of info online about cognitive distortions and methods to counter them."
897,hdchep6,,,insomnia,1631981842,Once a week? Just do your job tierd.. 3-4 hours of sleep once a week isnt too bad. Unless its a high potential for an injury job ofc.
898,hdcb1ac,,,insomnia,1631979123,"You might want to get checked for sleep apnea. 7 hours is a fair amount of sleep, imho… I probably average a little under 5.5, and I would kill for 7."

902,hdblrq2,,,insomnia,1631966267,"I once fought the urge and also took it after a few drinks. I was wandering around my boyfriends parent house half naked asking for chargers for my phone.

905,hdbk0lm,,,insomnia,1631965126,Some medical results to which i overreacted and it's not that serious.
906,hdbjr6l,,,insomnia,1631964950,Why did it start? If it started a week ago give it some time. Mirtazapine helped me and am sleeping notrmally
907,hdbg1t1,,,insomnia,1631962236,I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. I’m only 26. Ever since I went through psychosis in Dec 2020 I literally haven’t had one night of sleep without being heavily medicated it sucks
908,hdbf9h7,,,insomnia,1631961619,"I took it for the first time a few nights ago.

Went straight to bed but got auditory and visual hallucinations.

It was very scary and was like my past psychosis mental health issues.

Zopiclone has never done this to me but I unfortunately have a tolerance to that hence why I tired to swap pills (under my Dr supervision)"
909,hdbf4wo,,,insomnia,1631961519,Melatonin and valerian root? Sorry you are going through this.
910,hdbeqbk,,,insomnia,1631961188,"Hmm, I thought my chest burn was related to taking duloxetine as yesterday I didn't take one and didn't feel any chest problems, today I took it again and back to chest burns. I'm seriously debating just going all cold turkey at this point"
911,hdbdvd4,,,insomnia,1631960455,"It's all about predisposition.  
When my insomnia started I was awake for 6 days avg-ing 2-3 hours per day if that.  
My psychiatrist kept asking me if I had hallucinations and I replied no.   
I had of-course horrific dreams when closing my eyes and being sleep deprived.  
Although I feel for you,  I remember my psychiatrist always highlighting the fact that sleep deprivation was used as torture. We are all tortured here by our body."
912,hdbczv6,,,insomnia,1631959731,I try and It doesn help...it makes me mindlessly eat until I can fall asleep so I’m afraid to take it too early
913,hdbchcg,,,insomnia,1631959310,Take the traz at like 8
914,hdbcaj7,,,insomnia,1631959152,"This should be the top pinned post on this thread.   
You only have fatal insomnia if you had a known relatives died from this condition. You would figure it out and as you said you would really not be able to function normally in a couple of weeks because it doesn't get better just worst. It's like an aggressive cancer where you deteriorate quickly."
915,hdbc4vy,,,insomnia,1631959021,"I just didn't sleep on it. No weird behaviors, I would just fall asleep for like an hour then be wide awake all night. But I have paradoxical reactions to a lot of things."
916,hdbc22n,,,insomnia,1631958953,Both of those made me feel terrible and didn't do anything.
917,hdbby08,,,insomnia,1631958856,"It's almost 4 here too. I'm dealing with some very stressful family issues so last night I couldn't sleep and broke down and took .5 mg of melatonin. That's a small dose. I ended up awake all morning, I fell asleep three times and had awful, diabolical nightmares. My boyfriend thankfully was by my side to wake me up when he heard my whimpering. In the nightmares I was screaming. So here I am again await at almost 4 and now I've turned to alcohol which is not a good choice I know but I feel like I'm going crazy. I keep hearing this song on repeat in my head all the time. I'm constantly thinking of my family issues. I tried trazodone, it just made me feel awful. I was recently in the hospital for a ""seizure"". I think I collapsed from sheer exhaustion and stress. I collapsed in the doctors office and was transported to the ER where I woke up having no idea what had happened. I'm sure stress and insomnia was a huge part of it but I also had a terrible infection that was causing me extreme pain. They gave me a prescription for Valium after they cleared me and I've never slept better in my life. Ativan never worked well, Xanax did but I could never get that except through a relative once in a blue moon. I would probably pay like $20 for one damn Valium right now. I'm 47 and post Covid issues, family stress and perimenopause don't help. What do we have to do to get some rest? I doubt I'll even sleep at all, that would make me up for almost 2 days. I do feel like I'm losing my mind."
918,hdbbqvr,,,insomnia,1631958682,Never had any side effects other than metalic taste in the morning
919,hdbbny1,,,insomnia,1631958611,"Oh man I'm in almost the exact same boat as you. 

Around 2 weeks ago I was having chest pain, like a moron I didn't see a doctor about it until a few days later. Those few days I was up all night listening to my heartbeat worried that I was dying. Finally I went to urgent care. They told me it was just really bad acid reflux and gave me a prescription for some meds to help my gut. Those meds are working and the pain has gone away.... but sleep never really returned. I was up 3 nights in a row, of course making it worse for myself by looking up certian diseases that shall go unamed. I got a few hours of sleep in the morning for a couple days but after that it was another entirely sleepless 24 hours. 

2 nights ago I saw my GP and got prescriptions for trazodone and prozac. The first night the trazodone made me feel loopy as hell but I managed to sleep a decent amount, even though I still didnt feel rested. The second night I wasnt loopy but I was kept up all night by this burning in my chest. I looked and it is a rare side effect of trazodone. I emailed my Doc about quitting the meds but haven't gotten a reply. 

This is my first real bout of insomnia too. I feel like I'm in hell and just want to talk to people who have been though similar situations."
920,hdbbnk0,,,insomnia,1631958602,You should go on seroquel as you happen to be a good candidate for it. Your mind is hyperactive have you been diagnosed with F20 ailment spectrum or is psychosis due to something else?
921,hdbauyf,,,insomnia,1631957901,"Never had an issue at all with zopiclone, which is a z-drug similar to ambien. Sure, if you read stuff on the Internet, you'd get the impression you'll become a black-out rapist. It's garbage. 99.999% of people will have no serious side-effects like that.

In fact, I have no side-effects at all. Zero. And, according to real studies, that's normal.

The only semi-serious side-effect that is common is sleepiness the next morning. If you get that, and need to drive first thing in the morning, then take it earlier in the evening and go to bed early, so it's out of your system the next morning."

929,hdaxvk7,,,insomnia,1631946936,I take trazodone too but it makes me feel like I need to eat A LOT to go to bed. I thought it was only me that noticed eating helps me to fall asleep after taking trazodone but it also makes me feel so out of it that I eat more than I wanted.
930,hdaxkar,,,insomnia,1631946698,"I've had Ambien for a few week, 5mg at first then 10mg. I've never experienced any sleep walking, though the first night I took it, I had a weird dream and talked a bit in my sleep but that's it. 

If you really require it in order to function, I say take it. 

The best thing to do is keep all electronics away, take the Ambien and close your eyes. The temptation to watch something or scroll on your phone has to be fought. 

Hope you feel better soon."
931,hdavhvb,,,insomnia,1631945079,"Yes, grazed one is also an anti-anxiety and helps with insomnia.  It didn’t work for me but it does work for lots of people so I would try it!"
932,hdauj6l,,,insomnia,1631944352,Im so shook at how many people actually struggle this much with insomnia. It makes me feel better that I’m not alone :) but remember — nothing lasts forever and we are definitely stronger than our sleep issues.
933,hdataz9,,,insomnia,1631943448,"I got Moderna (first dose) on Tuesday &amp; haven’t been able to sleep since. I’ve been up since about 5 am every night and then wake up around 930-10. Never had this type of sleep pattern in my life. I’m having to smoke myself stupid (marijuana) to fall asleep and then I get this weird full body twitch that wakes me up again. &amp; my mind won’t stop racing. I also have adhd &amp; am prescribed adderall, but I haven’t taken any since Monday. I feel over-stimulated though like I have taken it. I also take 50 mg Zoloft daily. I’m beginning to wonder if the vaccine somehow messes with serotonin levels because I think some of my symptoms are somewhat comparable to that of serotonin syndrome. Hoping it doesn’t last long, either way."
934,hdaro06,,,insomnia,1631942307,Never had that issue. It’s only an issue of an infrequent problem that gets a lot of attention.
935,hdaq2tx,,,insomnia,1631941230,"Nope. No problem at all. Altho my friend can’t take it. She said her husband found her on top of the fridge one night. She takes lunesta instead. If you’re worried, start with a half tablet. In fact that’s all I need. I cut my 10 mg in half. I get about four hours then I wake up every half hour. But I do get back to sleep better."
936,hdape56,,,insomnia,1631940764,"It’s possible, i was on Ativan and after a stint in in-patient I used it way to often because they gave terrible advice which gave me terrible inter-dose withdrawal. Just contact your doctor or whoever prescribes your meds and see if upping the dose a small bit or changing would work. Changing around meds is okay and usually always something you gotta do to find the right thing"
937,hdap7ye,,,insomnia,1631940647,This is the exact reason I didn’t want to increase the dose but now worrying me that I’m having rebound insomnia due to the intolerance
938,hdaor5x,,,insomnia,1631940339,"Benzos are never meant to be used every day or long term, i used Klonopin every night for 4 years so I understand. You build tolerance quick, which is partially why its dangerous."
939,hdaokwy,,,insomnia,1631940226,Would Ativan intolerance come from taking it every day and for to long ? Over a year now would it cause disrupted sleep the only time I get 3+ hours is when I first take it to go to bed after that it’s up every hour to hour in a half
940,hdamft9,,,insomnia,1631938849,"Never drove or cooked or anything like that, but I did text my bf random gibberish on ambien. It’s advised that you take it and go to bed right away."

947,hdahhjc,,,insomnia,1631935899,"Let’s take some steps back, I promise you that you do not have a Prion disease. I’ve done enough reading, talking with people who have seen it first hand whether it’s physicians or family members of those deceased in groups because I too let severe insomnia and mental health issues that caused physical symptoms fool me into thinking I had one. Sleep abnormalities is actually not a major symptom of Prion disease, also if you had one it would be very apparent and you would not be able to post on Reddit let alone function. Definitely do yourself the biggest favor and leave that worry / reading in the past. It sounds like you built a tolerance to your dosage of Ativan, the first step would be to consult your pcp or psychiatrist on either upping the dose or trying out a new medication (Klonopin worked best for me). I’ve suffered from severe insomnia all my life and even under heavy medication still struggle, but finding the right meds, having a better diet, and practicing the best sleep hygiene is all you can do sometimes. Reading into insane stuff is just gonna fuel your anxiety, which piles on with your sleep anxiety, which is gonna kill your sleep. Also, invest in a Fitbit and or get a sleep study done, you’d be very surprised to find that you may be getting a bit more sleep than you can judge yourself."
948,hdacj1z,,,insomnia,1631933237,"Two weeks ago, I couldn’t sleep for 4 days straight. The 5th night I started hallucinating and sleep walking. One night I tried to open a car door that wasn’t mine. Another day I slept walked around my neighborhood for 2 hours venting to my friend that I had 8 hours to live because I just got an infected tattoo. Insomnia is real. I tried to get checked out by 2 urgent cares but they recommended me to a psychiatrist"
949,hdac8gy,,,insomnia,1631933087,"From what i know, zopiclone is a sleeping pill/sedative intended for insomnia while mirtazipine and amitriptyline are psych drugs, i believe antidepressants, with sedating effects. I took ambien with wellbutrin which is a sedative combined with an antidepressant and didnt have any more significant or new issues than when both were taken alone, but wellbutrin is very different from the 2 you are talking about. Antidepressants are usually not supposed to be taken as needed while sedatives like sleeping pills can be. I didnt have this issue with ambien but withdrawals are bad for both sleeping pills and antidepressants. Depending on how long you take them, you could be putting yourself into withdrawals regularly by rotating"
950,hdac873,,,insomnia,1631933083,I never sleep walked after taking it. But one time I took it and wasn’t able to go to bed and I spent a lot of money on Amazon on things I’d never normally buy and didn’t remember doing it. I was very confused when it started arriving.

Never intentionally did it but got caught up with doing stuff after had taken it instead of getting straight to bed, things did get a bit weird, strange visuals, coordination not great  etc so got to bed quickly.

970,hd9nxa2,,,insomnia,1631920877,"Yikes, that sounds awful! Some things to consider (basic sleep hygiene):

* Do you go to bed at a regular time?
* Do you get up at a regular time? 
* Do you have a bedtime wind-down ritual, or do you just stop and drop?
* How soon before bed to you put the screens away (laptop, phone, etc)?
* Are you getting outside for fresh air/exercise/ SUNLIGHT?

BTW, your parents are wrong-this is not a normal sleep schedule for a young person. Teens need more sleep than adults (8-9 hrs) because of all the growth that is happening."

974,hd9gmbf,,,insomnia,1631917413,"This is a great question worthy of a straightforward answer.

There are many factors, but two are most important -- sleep drive and body clock.  Sleep-wake is largely controlled by these two internal components.

Body clock is another term for your circadian rhythm.  The circadian alerting signal ebbs and flows over a 24 hour period.  When it ebbs, we feel drowsy.  When it flows, we feel more alert.

Your homeostatic sleep drive is a built-in tracker for wake time.  For most of us, after about 15-17 hours of nonstop wakefulness, it sends out a signal reinforcing the body clock.

When these two systems are aligned and in synch, sleep when you want it is practically irresistible.  To synch them, set and keep a very consistent wake time every morning.  You'll then begin to feel drowsy enough for sleep roughly 15-17 hours later.

Sounds simple, and it is."

977,hd9dnqy,,,insomnia,1631916038,"You must be in error. In many of your past posts you indicated that CBTi is for primary insomnia. Also, I googled some sleep sites and they also support your previous view that CBTi can be effective for primary insomnia, not for maintenance insomnia. 

I guess a drawback with CBTi is that although it can sometimes work for insomniacs with primary insomnia that still leaves about 75%-80% of insomniacs with maintenance insomnia that it won't address. However, if just a few people are helped in the smaller population of primary insomniacs then CBTi could change their lives and is certainly worth pursuing. 

Please keep in mind that I'm not trying to be critical here I just think that when we recommend a treatment for insomnia that we all provide a consistent message for those that are seeking advice."

Honesty for me, I’m trying to take on some lifestyle changes.

Isn’t it funny? Being anxious about sleep makes you not sleep and not sleeping makes you anxious, then you’re anxious because you’re not sleeping which means now you can’t sleep. It’s a vicious cycle.

A few nights, I gave up and took really smaller dosages of diphenhydramine with varying rates of success and failure as I suspected. A few nights I took 2.5 mgs Hydrocodone, + lidocaine patches, when the neuralgia was absolutely unbearable.  Off and on, I've been skipping taking my ADHD medication, for like 3 days or so but that seemed to do more harm than it did good. Today I actually took my meds again, and it felt okay despite not really sleeping, (I took caffeine without really accounting for the fact I haven't taken it in years, and couldn't sleep until like 2-3 am and had to wake up at like 5 to make it for imaging for my spine). 

My doctor admitted to just being completely against like all sedatives (not just benzos and barbs), and really couldn't justify a lot of it but I couldn't care anymore at this point. Although he ended up prescribing imipramine, but I'm against taking it as of now. Because of it's cardio and neurotoxicity, which I actually have known for awhile I just couldn't recall it when he prescribed it. Also I wasn't screened for Bipolar disorder which I should've been because of genetic predisposition and everyone should be looked at for it when prescribed imipramine. Also there's a lot of interactions between it and my ADHD medication, which I have to take it for weeks and weeks and months, so I'm not sure why he went with that option over guanfacine or clonidine, which are cardioprotective, and we're literally designed with the intention of being taken adjunct to Dextro-amphetamine sulfate, at least Intuniv was it's literally apart of it's human clinical trials for FDA approval, contrasted to tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants which are contradicted in a multitude of ways for ADHD medications. Also Guanfacine and Clonidine, are used for a number of comorbidities I have in relation to ADHD, such as ODD, and RLS, also Clonidine has been used for nerve pain. There's a lot to it, but it is what it is. 

At least I was able to get some imaging for my spine out of the way today, I'm supposed to change doctors in November, so waiting for that as well. I have a long term plan to see a sleep specialist, neurologist and such to take care of comorbidities I was previously able to ignore, but a lot of it is just waiting currently.

1037,hd7mss8,,,insomnia,1631889293,Read a physics book.
1038,hd7m11z,,,insomnia,1631888966,"I'm wondering what pills your doctor is giving you lol. Most are reluctant on giving anything beyond melatonin if your insomnia has been recent.

Anyway, I'll be the first to tell you to go cold turkey. Really, pills should only be considered at least two months in or if you're consistently not getting sleep for 2 days a fortnight.

There are many things for you to learn: Sleep hygiene, sleep association, circadian rhythm, melatonin/serotonin, etc.

You probably know what sleep hygiene is or can guess from the name. It involves doing healthy activities to optimise our environment for sleeping. Stuff like sleeping in the right temperature, being comfortable, being clean, exercising in the day but not before sleeping, not looking at bright devices near bed time, etc.

Sleep associations are psychological. When you look at someone, or even think about something, you might associate it with sleep. Insomniacs tend to have their beds associated with being alert and irritated, instead of being asleep. This is because they are used to staying up TRYING TO SLEEP instead of BEING ASLEEP while in bed. Babys have very strong sleep associations because they associate the bed with sleeping. This is very strong because they HATE SLEEPING, as they associate it with no more play time.

The circadian rhythm is the body's internal clock. To simplify, it's important to have a regulated and consistent circadian rhythm. A consistent circadian rhythm = consistent sleep schedule

Melatonin and serotonin are like opposite hormones. Melatonin SIGNALS your body it is time to sleep, but doesn't necessarily MAKE it sleep. Serotonin is a stress hormone which can be released more when you look at blue light. Blue light is found in sources like the SUN (natural), that's why getting out in the day is recommended so you can get serotonin.

But when you get serotonin at night, through the blue light in digital devices, it disrupts that balance. Since serotonin opposes melatonin, looking at screens can be viewed as lowering your melatonin levels at night (sorry for gross simplification).

A method I recommend to reset sleep schedules is SLEEP RESTRICTION. A lot of people, especially new insomniacs, find themselves unable to sleep. It can be for many reasons. Maybe they feel sleepy but can't sleep. Maybe they don't feel sleepy so they can't sleep. Maybe something is keeping them up like noise (physical) or anxiety (mental). Maybe they can sleep, but they keep waking up (sleep maintenance). Maybe they can sleep, but they don't feel rested (low-quality sleep).

Sleep restriction is to control the amount of time you stay asleep and limit it. You are willingly depriving yourself of a long sleep. When you are really tired from insomnia, especially new insomniacs, they tend to crash into bed and sleep in till the afternoon to catch up on sleep. DO NOT DO THIS. It varies for different people, but I recommend only letting yourself get 5 and a half hours of sleep. Also, when you wake up EMBRACE THE FEELING OF LETHARGY. Make yourself think thoughts like how sleepy you are, how you just want to sleep more. Let yourself click snooze on the alarm two more times, and then get up.

By letting yourself hit snooze, you are embracing your feelings of sleepiness and improving your sleep associations. Now after limiting your sleep, you should feel tired later in the day, Take this chance to sleep at an appropriate time and fix your sleep schedule for good. Maintain this sleep schedule for the next week and you should be good.

For sleep restriction, melatonin can be good simply to help regulate your circadian rhythm again. For some people, they feel sleepy after depriving themselves of sleep. But when it becomes night time, they are wide awake again. Melatonin can help combat this issue. But for most people, you should still be tired and let yourself sleep again.

Also, don't let yourself sleep in and never sleep more than 8 hours. Try to get 7 and a half hours if the sleep restriction works.

I absolutely don't recommend trazodone or other medication if it gives you heart pain. Just not worth it lol, you got this man you don't even need those medicine anyway. Use melatonin at most, but sparingly. Use it every 3 days imo, but every 2 days if you feel like you can sleep well.

And don't take sleeping pills late at night, for example 5AM. Sleeping at late times reinforces a bad sleep schedule, and a disorganised circadian rhythm like I said before. If you can't sleep, just get out of bed and do a light activity and MAKE SURE TO USE DIM LIGHTS. Install blue light filters on all your devices, and use ones that can reduce your brightness even lower than the minimum.

Good luck"

 I totally understand your concerns, but it will fade away soon, my dear! I’ve had these problems for like 8 years, and there will always be the day where you acctually sleep. Very hard. 

You’ve already come a long way dealing with this, keep seeing your doctor/therapist! (I prefer a good therapist). You WILL sleep soon, and so will i ❤️

Best of luck, soldier."
1040,hd7gzif,,,insomnia,1631886728,"surprisingly, olanzapine somehow fixed my sleep onset. I am able to feel the sleep drive every night after stopping my meds. I took it mainly for insomnia but was on it short term.

For vitamin C - I noticed it from drinking lot of rosehip tea and putting sea buckthorn oil on my face. Every time I did either of those, couldn’t sleep. Gave rosehip tea to my brother in law and he had the same problem, although he never suffers from insomnia usually. 

Vitamin D - I’m not 100% sure, but I read somewhere so I stopped taking large doses. I used to be vitamin d deficient, but the last blood test showed I was in normal range now. 

I have a suspicion that also my body simply can’t produce enough serotonin sometimes, which is a precursor for melatonin. 

Been taking 3-6 mg of Trader Joe’s melatonin lately due to PMS and that seems to be helping, plus listening to calming music on my phone and sleeping on the couch.

That triggers more wakeful time for me. So I started doing my old routines like staying in bed, using phone, reading in bed. I can fall asleep pretty fast. While my sleep is still not as good as before, I get to sleep most of the hours I am in bed and wake up refreshed. It’s the sleep anxiety that was removed from it I guess."

Idk what happened but I used to be able to sleep through anything as a child. I need everything pitch dark and the only sound is my ceiling fan. I can't tolerate heat but my body needs to still feel ""covered"" and thank god my house is the coldest in the winter. 

As long as I get 6 hrs I'm fine. Over or under 6 hrs Im tired. I used to be on stimulants for ADHD but I never liked the crash and I have high blood pressure now. I think Ill talk to my doctor about getting onto a non-stimulant and see how that fairs.

Im happy to report I got roughly two rem cycles of sleep. Im bored and waiting for the rest of the world to wake up.

The funny thing is when I do stress I don't eat. So, you may be onto something.

1069,hd6ogan,,,insomnia,1631867737,"The dosage can’t be right. 50mg is extremely high, normally the highest dose is 20mg or *maybe* 30mg. But starting Zyprexa at 25mg and then going to 50 after a week? No, that can’t be correct. It must be a different drug or different dosage. Or you have seen a very reckless doctor!

Olanzapine will make you sleep. But it also damages the natural ability to sleep. So the sedating effect will wear off over time, and you may not be able to sleep at all if you ever try to stop taking it. It also causes other damage including diabetes and shrinking the brain, plus increased risk of heart problems, movement disorders and more. This drug should only be used to bring someone out of psychosis or mania. If you are not experiencing those, please do not take it."
1070,hd6oddj,,,insomnia,1631867663,"Urgh - I FEEL YOU! It's awful. For me the cause of my insomnia is stress, if that's the case for you meds won't really work until you can solve the cause of your anxiety/stress.  

Your brain is a lizard brain.  If you're stressed about something, your brain doesn't know the difference between that and like, a tiger eating your baby or whatever.  So, for me, repeating over and over, ""I'm safe, my children are safe."" really helps my lizard brain calm the eff down.

Also, I think most sleep doctors agree that if you're not sleeping, get out of bed. You don't have to 'do' anything, just don't turn on lights, go to your sofa and put on a tv show. This helps me about 70% of the time because my brain is occupied with watching the show so it can't think about whatever is stressing me out and then I can get more sleep that way.

Also, you can't think two thoughts at once, so for, sometimes what helps is a trick I read here ages ago: go through the alphabet naming three things for each letter (ant, art, alien, bird, book, bat, cat, car, container etc.). If your brain is thinking of words, it can't think of other stuff so for me this works sometimes.

My routine is go to sleep (which I have no problem doing), then when I wake up after a couple hours I try the alphabet thing. If I'm still awake after going through it twice (sometimes I'll try it in French or Polish or Mandarin - other languages I know) I go down to the living room and put on a youtube playlist I have. That usually works so I can at least, and then if I start to feel sleepy again I try to go back up to bed but sometimes I just sleep on the sofa. The goal with leaving the bed (it's part of CBT sleep therapy) is that you start to associate bed with sleep.

1081,hd6ezz6,,,insomnia,1631859504,"i get ur pain OP. Why are people giving you a hard time lol. I have had insomnia since I was 10 years old and I can agree that you are experiencing hell rn! I've had months of no sleep but then months of 6h+ yet I am still an insomniac. No clue why people are hating on you since your post didnt indicate that you had it worse off than others (unless it was edited?) sadly I have no advice except get your vitamins/minerals checked and making sure you are eating enough throughout the day, since having too empty of a stomach can cause you to have insomnia. My friend had insomnia for 2 weeks and blamed it on stress, but it wasnt the stress itself but rather the stress making her eat less which caused hunger induced insomnia, even if you dont feel hungry.

Things that have helped me: listening to a podcast/subliminals (they have words under the music which help keep my brain occupied so its not worrying as much, I have adhd which is what is responsible for some of my insomnia), magnesium citrate (calming and anti anxiety)  drinking a lot of water, eye mask (makes face feel secured) fans constantly going, weighted blanket, CBN oil (but wont help you since marijuana isnt legal where you live, unless CBN tinctures are allowed? definitely helps my sleep). Biggest fix was taking a stimulant through the day though and creating a nightly ritual (skincare routine) that doesnt change too much. I associate sleep with the night ritual now and dont do the full thing on nights I feel I wont get a lot of sleep, to ensure I keep associating it with sleep. 

A huge thing though, since we sound very similar in how our insomnia presents/started, is if you cant fall asleep after being in bed at a certain time is get out of it. When I get out of bed after a couple hours and go do something that isnt sleep related, if I go back to bed I usually fall asleep. I learned when this works for my body though based on feeling. It doesnt always work (i didnt get any sleep 2-3 nights last week lol) but if i dont do this then I never stop focusing on sleep/worrying about getting enough and that prevents me from sleeping. My anxiety and thoughts about being unable to sleep is the main thing that causes my insomnia, if I can prevent those thoughts or do things to not focus on them (listening to podcast or subliminals that stimulate my hearing while also reading reddit, so basically keeping my sight+hearing constantly occupied all help me not focus on the thoughts)  then I usually fall asleep within an hour and stay asleep."

First, unless you have something very important the next day I would say NOT to take sleeping pills past 4:30AM. If you sleep at late times, you're reinforcing a late sleep schedule which makes it harder to sleep next time.

You should do sleep restriction. If you're waking at 4PM, I'm inclined to believe that you had a crash sleep and you're sleeping in.

DO NOT LET YOURSELF SLEEP IN. Limit your sleep to 5 and a half hours and get up again, then you will feel sleepy enough to sleep again the next night. You can fix your sleep schedule this way."

Pro and con. Kinda became numb, not happy but not sad. Wich was a relief for awhile. But the lack of feeling eventually was likened to being depressed because without joy i became hopeless. So i quit and became extremely depressed.

1097,hd5yq5d,,,insomnia,1631849316,"It's a fairly new realization I believe. Also, it's easy to take at the wrong time. It works best at observed sunset. Meaning pop one and watch the sun go down. This helps your circadian rhythm do its thing. 

I also recently came across an article that purity tests revealed there was a significant variance in the amount found in the dosage vs what was labeled.

I haven't checked other comments yet but has anyone suggested magnesium L-threonate? It's the variety least likely to give you the drizzling shits and it's a common deficiency for people.

Exercise, like bust a good sweat for at least an hour.

No blue light (this is why it's important to watch the sun go down. So no screen time, and nothing wrong with keeping ""night mode"" on your phone and computer all the time. On the other hand, getting blue light (like high noon sunshine) is equally important for your circadian rhythm.

I would put money on the fact that you've built a tolerance to everything you've been taking for sleep. Go a few days without caffeine, sweat like a pig, and nix any screen time and you will feel a lot better.

Don't underestimate the power of a 30 minute nap. I work 24-48 hour shifts and I am literally up for 24 hours straight, operating dangerous machinery (an ambulance), saving people from their toe pain, stomach aches and occasionally when their heart stops. If I'm lucky I get one of those 30 minute naps. I'm good for 8 hours after that, not even exaggerating. I also suffer from insomnia, have since I was a kid. I cant tell you how many nights I have laid there, not being able to sleep, stressing out about how soon my alarm clock is going off. It especially sucks because I naturally get tired around 2 am, and my alarm goes off at 4 am. So I assure myself that at some point I will get tired. That has been most conducive to me falling asleep.

Finally, make sure it's nice and cold in your room when you hit the sack. Running a fan for a nice, steady sound that's easy to drown out helps so much. Im sure you've heard of ""white noise,"" but the problem is there is also pink noise and brown noise. If you want to bore yourself to sleep one night look into it. Some 'colors' help one person sleep but stimulates the next person's mind. Play around with it but do your due diligence first.

Another actually interesting read is that 30 minute nap. There have been a few studies. The first was by Harvard I think, they said 22 minutes was the most optimal nap time. Their test subjects were their students, and they monitored both their information retention and performance. NASA says anywhere between 20 and 30 minutes, and the FAA says 30 I believe. These are both high risk, heavily mental jobs if you will. It's enough time to give your brain a rest but not enough to start the next sleep cycle. It's crazy but you wake up feeling great, you actually cannot tell you've slept. While deep sleep is important to regenerating, my point is that it might take the worry off your shoulders... and it might even be possible that you are getting a little sleep and not know it. You just feel good for hours. Its not unreasonable to extrapolate that you might even think you can't sleep because you simply don't feel tired after.

If you can't get to the doctor for blood work, eat a very well balanced diet. Start this right away. Leafy greens, healthy protein, no sugar, low carbs, and lots of water. Get that sunshine. Sweat. It's almost always related to your existing health habits.

Good luck my friend."

1107,hd5nc0o,,,insomnia,1631843683,the blue goli gummies for calmness. anxiety and sleep is the absolute BEST!!! they have all positive reviews.  look them up.  but make sure it’s the Goli brand and the blue bottle.
1108,hd5n75q,,,insomnia,1631843620,that would make more sense but she did say 25 mg. maybe they mixed it up but im not sure my tolerance is very high that 400mg of seroquel wouldnt put me to sleep.
1109,hd5mn56,,,insomnia,1631843363,"U sure it’s 25mg and not 2.5? Starting off with 25 would not kill you but it would knock you tf out and probably mess you up for days. 50 is just dangerous. The highest FDA-approved dose is 20mg, but hospitals typically go up to 30mg, and sometimes the very severe patients go to 40mg. I’ve never seen 50 though. I was on 20mg and while it brought me out of my psychosis and made me sleep, I became a vegetable. I was so damn stupid I couldn’t even follow the plot of a simple movie or TV show (and I never watch tv because usually it’s not intellectually stimulating enough). It made me sleep 15hrs a night at first. Then around 12hrs. You definitely need sleep, so listen to ur doc, but also be careful. Zyprexa does work very well usually though."

1111,hd5mgha,,,insomnia,1631843277,As a fellow insomniac maybe you could try going to Nootropic Depot online and get some Ashwagandha. Delivery is usually in 3 days and the company is very well respected. They even have a subreddit.  Check it out. I have had severe insomnia for years and just started taking this over the summer. I take it at night and it makes me tired. I have been getting a better night sleep and wake up refreshed. Your mileage may vary but it seems to work right now for me.
1112,hd5ja7b,,,insomnia,1631841784,Yeah I guess I’d stop taking it too if you never felt well rested. Not worth it! I hope you find a way to sleep well soon ❤️

1114,hd5g4dq,,,insomnia,1631840291,i was on olanzapine for 3.5 weeks. 5mg knocked the hell out of me to a good 10-12 hours. No other side effects aside from being too sleepy throughout the day.
1115,hd5g1vb,,,insomnia,1631840258,"Wait your doc wants you back on Zoloft even though at high dosages you had a seizure?! Was the Zoloft directly correlated to the seizure? I’m actually shocked your doc would even put you back on a med that could have caused a seizure! An md told me quetiapine actually works better at high mg! I was like nah fuck that. I was prescribed trazodone 50mg yesterday for my insomnia. Everything I read stated there’s NO WAY to fight the sleep from the medication. Obviously I was excited for this… took it at 11pm and didn’t fall asleep until 6am then had plenty of sleep disturbances, crazy vivid dreams. When I woke up I was up for 2 hours and then felt overwhelmed with tiredness. Slept 4 hours…. I’m actually laying in bed typing this… I hear you on tired of being tired all the time. And I feel like no doctor can explain or figure out a solution to our sleep deprivation. I wouldn’t wish this on anybody.."

1117,hd5cxos,,,insomnia,1631838791,I quit caffeine 40 years ago and I think it help a little. Also I drink very little alcohol. Not the cure for sure but I think it helps the quality of the sleep I do get.

I was on 50 mg for years but currently on 100 (last year was bad). Right now I’m weaning down to 75 and eventually I’d love to just be on 50 again, but I don’t plan on going off of it completely.

But also suffer from myoclonus which started in April. Whats weird is it only happens when I first start to sleep and doesn't happen when I wake up during the night.
1132,hd4wara,,,insomnia,1631830765,Well since it sounds like u want to wake up earlier then pick an earlier time u want to wake up and no matter what time u fall asleep force urself to wake up and get out of bed at that time. U would usually wound up being extremely tired and when u force urself to only sleep within that 5.5 window ur sleep starts becoming more consistent and once u sleep at 85% or greater of that window then u can increase it by sleeping 15 mins earlier

1134,hd4uf98,,,insomnia,1631829918,It sucks. I understand your frustration. Please don’t give up hope though. I have battled this for 5 years now. Some weeks I can go sleeping well and then out of nowhere I am in a bout of full blown insomnia. And certain remedies that help others sometimes do not help you. Marijuana gives me terrible anxiety so does not help me at all! You will find a way to cope but maybe go back to your doctor one more time and be persistent that you need some relief in terms of sleeping pills. Also think about if anxiety or depression could be a part of it. I was in denial that I had anxiety and mild depression for so long but it makes sense now the traumas I went through as a child. Anyway you are not alone

This is my sleep cycle and I do not know if it’s considered normal sleeping still.

I am too afraid to start cbti and srt because they are mostly geared towards onset which I do not have a problem to begin with. I can go to bed and be out in seconds."

1141,hd4scsk,,,insomnia,1631828995,"So should my window be earlier or later since I’m more of a morning person? Or just count back from when I want to ideally wake up?

Really tire yourself out both mentally and physically.  Doing that, combined with the sleep debt you've accumulated, is a very positive sign you'll sleep much better the following night.

1208,hd3knu4,,,insomnia,1631811073,"With 100-150mg trazadone and a lot of dabs(concentrated wax from marijuana cause flower doesn’t do shit for me anymore and I would need to eat an entire tray of edibles to be able to get the benefit of them which would then make me sick from eating an entire tray of anything) I get about 4-5 hours continuous. But when I wake up, I’m up. 

I have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and with sleeping in general. Im a super light sleeper and before I had the trazodone I wouldn’t get more than 1-2 hours of sleep a night if I was lucky. Usually I would just stay up for a few days, crash out for about 2-4 hours after I exhaust myself to the max and rinse/repeat the cycle after I’m woken up by whatever. But that’s not healthy and definitely made my mental health plummet."
1209,hd3k5g6,,,insomnia,1631810875,I can’t tell you how many doctors here and there have tried to tell me that seroquel doesn’t actually have any evidence of helping a person sleep and I’m probably experiencing a placebo! That’s when I know the doctor isn’t for me. Absolutely no possible way I’m benefiting from the placebo effect here haha. The dry mouth is quite annoying though!
1210,hd3j1gc,,,insomnia,1631810437,"I switched from coffee to black tea (1-2 cups in the morning, 1-2 cups after the lunch nap), and for me it made a huge difference. Together with an emphasis on proper sleep hygiene and proper diet ( lots of fresh vegetables ,rarely meat, no convenience food, no bread, rarely milk products, rarely sugar) i turned from a 3-4 hour sleeper to a full 7-8 hours sleeper. My life quality has improved drastically."
1211,hd3hk4y,,,insomnia,1631809847,"Hmmm... It would indeed seem like you're dreaming but the quality of sleep must be incredibly low. That said, I don't know how the sleep quality is so low despite being able to dream and actually fall asleep in the first place.

This is probably a physical issue instead of a psychological one. I think you would benefit from having a sleep study. Maybe you have sleep apnea

Well you probably do have sleep apnea lol. People getting sleep but not feeling rested at all is infamously associated with sleep apnea in this community.

If you're lazy to google it, it's basically when you stop breathing during sleep for a few moments.

Are you a shallow breather in general?"
1212,hd3ha6x,,,insomnia,1631809736,"I absolutely feel you on the time skipping while staring at the ceiling. When this happens to me I usually do eventually fall asleep around 5 am or so, but it can feel like I was up the whole time. Ofc I don’t know your experience but I think you may have fallen asleep, but our minds are so used to insomnia that your brain is tricking you into thinking you didn’t, you know? Your brain might just not be working because getting very few hours of sleep isn’t great either, so you’re still going to feel tired. On nights like these I typically try giving up and taking a sleeping aid, flipping to the other side of the bed (this works really well for me), or getting up and doing something else like reading or working out (just no screens)"
1213,hd3gttq,,,insomnia,1631809555,Maybe it's just less comfortable sleeping in the summer.
1214,hd3g7oh,,,insomnia,1631809308,"Thanks, yeah I’m using a Fitbit to monitor. I’m quite a sensitive sleeper so I think I’d notice if I was snoring or making noise, which is what I associate with apnea.

I took several medications (including a double-dose of ambien), but nothing worked. I ended up in and out of inpatient psychiatric treatment eight years ago due to the severity of my insomnia (along with the crippling anxiety and depression that went with it). There, I was eventually placed on 300mg seroquel. Within five days, my insomnia abated. I still have tough nights on occasion, but I am happily down to 50mg. Thank you for posting your story! What happened to me makes me feel like such a weirdo, so I love to hear that seroquel has helped others."

1237,hd2wvw1,,,insomnia,1631801448,They're not that accurate IME. I have a Garmin one and on nights when I have no sleep at all it still says I got at least 4 hours. On the nights I do sleep for 3 - 5 hours it sometimes says I got as much as 12 hours. Instead of going by the hours it says I slept I instead look at my movement activity during the night and it is always a much better picture of how much rest I actually got. I think I may try one of the more expensive ones and see if that is better.

1241,hd2u1c0,,,insomnia,1631800210,"yes, recently. like 4 months ago. it was also 4 months ago that i completely stopped exercising so i dont know if that was partly to blame. I have been continuously exercising Dec 2019 until May 2021 when all of these happened."
1242,hd2tkp3,,,insomnia,1631800007,"I've worked really hard on my sleep for the last 8 years or so. I currently take melotonin most nights and get about 8 hours with one or two wakenings.

However when I disrupt my routine (even a couple of glasses of wine will mess me up) it usually takes about 2/3 days to recover, during which I don't sleep or get approx 4 hours until I gradually start to catch up.

I make sure I have melotonin, valium and CBD in just in case it gets bad again. I'm usually quite practiced at being underslept though, and will do things like start work at 5am (I have flexi hours in part), avoid naps and such to get me back on track."

1249,hd2pgor,,,insomnia,1631798082,"If you haven’t tried it yet, you can try sleep hypnosis or sleep stories along with a white noise machine.

I am sure that I'm also having nightmares that I'm not asleep and waking up feeling crap cos I've dreamt all night that I'm not asleep.
I've found sleep music on at night helps, I use calm but also some of the free ones as I then get used to the music. I can then concentrate on the music and it helps to stop the anxiety not always but more than not."

I'm starting on 25 mg of Zoloft; I tried 100mg in the past and it gave me seizures which is why I've been hesitant to try it but my doc encouraged me to try a micro dose (maybe that's all I need?).

I don't feel tired yet so I'm good right now but I'm worried that I won't sleep soon. The longest I've gone with absolutely no sleep was 5 nights and by then I was hallucinating. I ended having to take a couple Xanax which finally knocked me out.

I have had insomnia my whole life. I can remember being around 3 or 4 and being awake when my dad got home from work after midnight. It affected me horribly in school and I dropped out at 15. 

I finally got medicated in my late 30s. Ambien to put me to sleep and trazadone to keep me asleep, and then they stopped working.

I've been off everything for about 10 years.

I'm starting a new job Monday so that might have my brain working overtime.

You can get this antihistamine called promethazine OTC from the pharmacy. It makes you very drowsy and is often used as a sleeping aid. Maybe try that?"

I’m on 200mg of Zoloft and a bunch more but I take my meds in the am. The later I take my meds, the less likely I’ll sleep. Either way I never feel like I’m getting quality sleep….

1285,hd23bso,,,insomnia,1631783094,"These things are not clear-cut, it's a matter of weighing up all the pros and cons. 

High cholesterol on its own is generally not a worry, but it does contribute to your cardiovascular risk profile. Whether your cholesterol is concerning enough to warrant statins depends on your other risk factors, e.g. age above 35, smoking history, obesity, diabetes status, blood pressure, family history, personal history of stroke/heart attack, etc. Some of these factors are more weighty than others. e.g. a person who has had a heart attack needs lifelong statin therapy, no doubt about it. A 36 year old probably doesn't need statins in the absence of other risk factors. 


Your psychiatrist may believe that swapping mirtazapine for a different agent is a better option than adding a statin on top of your medication burden. 

It's probably a fair decision — you're not married to your antidepressant. If you find that nothing else works as well as mirtazapine, you can always go back to it. But there's no sense being resigned to a medication that is increasing your risk of heart attack and stroke when there are other options out there that don't carry such risk."

If I can just get 3-4 good sleeps I don't feel anxious anymore but it's clear that I'm not going to get those sleeps unless I take the Zoloft or completely knock myself out by doubling my Quetiapine.

1297,hd1usx1,,,insomnia,1631775251,we are practically the same although it’s almost always 2-3x for me. Any reason for your awakenings? Like underlying medical issues?
1298,hd1sqs9,,,insomnia,1631773581,"I can't sleep at all.  If I succeed in falling asleep I wake up every hour for nothing. But usually, I don't fall asleep, it drives me crazy and I lay in my bed, or do something else until 5am or 6am then I get up, or if  I am k\^lucky, I close my eyes and sleep for one hour our two.

I'm worried about it. Since my doctor can't do anything to improve my sleep,  I'll go to a sleep clinic. I have to wait until October for my first appointment. 🥲"
1299,hd1pxh6,,,insomnia,1631771473,Saw no difference for me sadly

On average, I get 7 hours of sleep and wake up 2-4 times for shirt periods when I'm not really stressed. When I am stressed, it could be anywhere from 4-6 hours with multiple wakes and long stretches of being up."

I’ll stay in bed and get some fitful sleep but nothing restorative.  I am barely able to function in my day to day right now so I’m starting Zoloft again this weekend because I can’t keep going on without sleep and it’s completely anxiety based for me.  I’m currently on 50 mg of quetiapine and some prescription antihistamine that’s supposed to make me drowsy but I don’t see much of a difference with that.

Short term, what you can try is a very consistent sleep schedule that ensures enough time in bed every night for proper sleep.  If you do that over the course of several weeks, and have a consistent wake time, then at some point you'll awaken spontaneously -- when you've had enough sleep -- without any alarm at all."

1372,hd0jgu0,,,insomnia,1631749039,"Hi! Firstly I am so sorry for what you're going through. I'm in the exact same place, but it has been worse than this where I've gone 10 days without sleep. Multiple visits to the ER. Almost lost my mind.

Friend, the only thing that has ever worked for me, is to accept the situation. I understand that might sound like a whole load of bs but SERIOUSLY: when you fight harder to sleep, sleep gets harder. It doesn't work like that- you can't force sleep, or actively do things to make yourself fall asleep. You need to get through the day without constantly focusing on how you'll sleep tonight and without talking about it too often. I know it feels super rough when you're this sleep deprived, but if you can direct your attention elsewhere, away from the constant thinking and worrying about sleep. Then I promise you it will get better. No, it isn't an instant fix- I still struggle half the time, but I also have more nights where I sleep better. They used to be 0 before.

If you can, get The Sleep Book by Dr Guy Meadows ASAP. Here is the link:
 https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleep-Book-Well-Every-Night/dp/140915761X/ref=asc_df_140915761X/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=310831936698&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17807770810310156774&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9045901&amp;hvtargid=pla-452845388150&amp;psc=1 

This book is the only thing I would actually recommend, having suffered with insomnia for 10 years plus. And anyway, you have nothing to lose. 

Truly hoping you start to feel better soon. I know how lonely and desparate this can be."
1373,hd0j95r,,,insomnia,1631748936,"Hi, 

I fully understand your struggle. This was me for YEARS. My body got really kind of wrecked because of this, which is probably Sleep Maintenance Insomnia. I'm not a doctor, but I'll bet that's what a specialist would call it.  Consider using a sleep app to find out if you snore. My issue was sleep apnea, and once I got treatment, my life changed. I also have anxiety/nervous system related insomnia which I still have to work with. Like another commenter, it's SO important not to make things worse by worrying yourself too much about it. I repeat to myself ""it's not a bit deal"". ""I'll be fine"".  When I really need it I just retreat ""sleep...sleep...sleep..."" So much of it is a mind game, and getting out of your thought patterns to just relax the body and mind. So much of insomnia is just having a feeling of SAFETY and allowing yourself to relax. Some things that were also extremely helpful: think about installing f.lux on your computer. It'll block some of the blue light, and also maybe turn the brightness of your screen down. Avoid sugar before bed. I've noticed that makes my system speed up. I don't know what your caffeine intake is, but I was a coffee addict for many many years and I couldn't imagine giving up my afternoon or after dinner coffee, but when I did, things really shifted too, but it took a week or two for the body to adjust. Just my two cents and I hope you will find some relief, you can do it!"

This is the only anti-depressant drug I've seen so far that *appears* to overall generally improve brain functionality both short and long term and with minimal side effects.  I have my own belief that pharmaceutical companies will try anything to raise drug sales without much interest in the well-being of their users. Trazodone makes a compelling trustworthy choice if anything because, despite a few studies still being made on Trazodone, the patent on the drug has long expired making its production not very profitable.

So no, it's not safe at all. Consider being sleep deprived just like being drunk.

It wears off over time and eventually you’ll need more and more until they can’t go any higher. That happened in my case and then my doctor said “well at this point the only pill I believe would help you are benzodiazepines.” Which I now take for sleep. If you can go years on it without building a tolerance and it helps with no side effects-then do it!! I also would wake up every morning with the worst anxiety. And groggy as all hell.

1418,hczlqvj,,,insomnia,1631734603,"Totally agree on better ways than drugs/substances.

The usual reason they don't work is because they're not addressing the true underlying cause for the sleep disruption.  In your case, given your med history, this is probably best discussed with your prescribing doc.

That said, you probably have at least some overlap with nonmed issues causing this.  They're usually some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  Your descrip also suggests hyperarousal, and that's usually caused by excessive and/or unremitting stress/anxiety during the day -- and often well into the night from the idea of sleep.  Or lack thereof.

The best natural methods are contained in a CBT sleep training system.  That gives you a substance free comprehensive approach, but you'd need to discuss if this is appropriate with your doc.  Possibly in combo with your meds or with some tapering strategy to eventually get you completely off."

However, it's not true insomnia unless you're also suffering from some adverse consequence on daytime performance, such as excessive drowsiness, fatigue, moodiness.

If so, the usual first step is for a checkup, to ensure nothing medical.  If nothing, then it's usually some nonmedical combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  To treat that substance-free, the standard of care is use of a CBT sleep training system."
1421,hczj1hr,,,insomnia,1631733517,"Definitely not safe. Even if not sleep deprived and you feel tired while driving you should take a break. 

So if severely sleep deprived then you will be even more at risk as cognitive function is impaired, similar if you had been drinking. It's not worth the risk killing you or some innocent person."

I am telling you this because I want you to know I do not have anxiety or pain issues that would keep me up.  This is pure insomnia now having said that yes I get anxious before going to bed knowing I will not sleep. I am retired now it gets better with not having the school kids and jobs. What I have done that helps.  I have not have had caffeine for 40 years.  I do eat some dark chocolate in the morning for a boost.  I did gain alot of weight using food as a way to stay awake.  When I turned 50 I got a dr. to give me some sleeping pills they do help. the best thing I do not is use an ediable form of THC that helps the best if you live somewhere where this is legal. I also use cognitive behaviour therpy.  that is staying up late and getting up the same time everyday.  This helps also some.  I take a magnesium supplement this seems to help me stay asleep.

One of the best I've found is attacking stress at its root -- the negative underlying stressful thought patterns.

You can try a number of things to address this.  One is to ensure you're not allowing too much time in bed for your needs.  That usually means no sleeping in and no napping, and having a bedtime that only allows the min time needed for proper sleep.

Another is to use in-bed relaxation methods to help yourself fall back asleep, when awakened.  These typically include deep breathing and muscle relaxation.

A third is to repeatedly remind yourself you'll be OK by just accepting rest in bed as the next best thing.  Sometimes the best thing to do is just let go the worry best you can, as worry feeds the insomnia."

I found it didn't help increase my sleep. All it did was mess up my sleep schedule, making it even more difficult to go to sleep when I finally stopped it.

When I stop, I will get a really bad sleep the first night. But, I don't think that's dependence. It's just that I'm caught up on sleep, and my body doesn't like that. The 2nd or 3rd night is much better.

If you find that you've developed a dependence or tolerance, then perhaps take a couple of months off. You should discuss with your doctor, obviously."

Just because you used to be able to sleep fine on those drugs at one point in your life doesn't mean you can't develop insomnia as a side effect from them later on.

Also, I can relate to taking a drug that helps you sleep for a while, then after a short time it stops working. This happens to me with everything I have ever tried, even melatonin. It's like my body develops a tolerance very quickly. Sometimes taking time off from the drug or supplement, then starting back up later on can make it work for a short time again.

Or you could offer to sleep over at his place instead, since that is presumably an environment he has already grown accustomed to for sleeping. 

And also, I'm not sure how this experience is for other insomniacs, but for me, personally, I've grown accustomed (or maybe resigned) to the general lack of sleep and a constant feeling of tiredness...it is my burden to bear and I don't need my partner to do anything to try to support me. Frankly, there isn't anything he can do that I haven't already tried, and my biggest fear is that any action on his part would stress me out and further worsen my sleep issues."

I find the one that’s far easier to do while sleep deprived is produce because the physical activity gets adrenaline going and it doesn’t require as much thought. Psychotherapy requires a lot more thought and there’s a lot of sitting, making it easy to get sleepy.

You'll get bored, because you won't be able to find anything worthwhile when you just have 30 mins left.

1510,hcwlbvo,,,insomnia,1631674489,"There's a lot of lengthy responses here, so I will try to offer a shorter one. Sleep is like the most visceral thing insomniacs deal with usually on a daily basis. It causes more frustration than usually just about anything for anyone, because it's so misunderstood, yet seems so simple and is taken for granted. It's like someone not knowing why you can't open a door but they don't realize you're missing a hand and when you try to explain it's not there, they say something along the equivalent of ""Why not just get another one?"".

Be patient and give your partner space with their sleep, but also be prepared to deal with grumpiness and frustration. I've given my fair share of grumpiness to others. It's not personal, but don't settle for abuse or failings either. Your partner sounds lucky to have you."

Then randomly 5 years ago I woke up at 2am unable to go back to sleep, this continued night after night for weeks, and this would come and go. I tried various remedies and visited doctors, and this has been an on and off battle ever since. I have to say I feel that I have it more under control now, and I don’t think this is because of anything I am doing differently. Although last night I couldn’t sleep a wink, after having a lovely day off with my partner, I had healthy food, did yoga, we watched a movie and ate dinner, really relaxing happy vibes, so no idea why I couldn’t switch off and I ended up having one of the worst nights in a long time and missing work today.

1514,hcwhgjj,,,insomnia,1631672599,"I think this is very difficult. If hes leaving early then theres also a chance that sex is actually not very enjoyable right now and he may be going through the motions. This is cause he is exhausted.

Hes probably beating himself up more than you are worrying. 

Its really difficult but honestly I would be direct and ask him how hes feeling and work within this. If hes tired then its a supportive night but he'll sometimes feel a bit better and maybe thats a more 'we' night - sadly this will not be scheduled. Its super difficult.

If he works in the morning then I would support him in waking and travel if possible.

I suppose its going to be personal to him so you need to think about 'your' boyfriend and what he needs as well as communicating your own needs. With something like Insomnia theres going to have to be a bit of a compromise."

1516,hcwgcnt,,,insomnia,1631672070,"You aren't alone, but you're in the minority.  It does help most people.

Stress management is an important component in a full CBT sleep training system, as is cognitive restructuring.  Using all the methods simultaneously, most people reduce overall stress levels, and use cognitive restructuring to counter the negative belief that SR increases stress instead of improving sleep.  Using these methods, basically you learn to change your thinking about sleep to something better and more positive.

It may be that you're experiencing stress levels beyond that which you can control.   
 Wondering what your sleep doc is recommending now.  Do you think at some point you'll give it a go again?"

It can help determine if there's any underlying issues, but it wouldn't be for insomnia per se.

That's because insomnia isn't some sort of disease.  It's only a symptom.  A complaint.  Always caused by something else going on deeper causing the sleep disruption.

If you did have some sort of imbalance or deficiency, that'd likely show up in other symptoms in addition to insomnia.

The most common causes for insomnia aren't even medical -- usually some nonmed combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  For that the usual recommendation is use of a CBT sleep training system."

If you're absolutely too wired to sleep, get up and write down any of your worries about school down on paper.  Now you control them, they don't control you.  Head back to bed when you feel drowsy and tell yourself you'll worry about all that tomorrow, and just get some rest now."

1539,hcvn3en,,,insomnia,1631658599,"I want to chime in as insomnia’s favorite slave. 
First, I’ll try to give you some insight into what it’s like living with it for me. I hit the trifecta with insomnia of not only inheriting it from my family (literally found it documented in journals and such, from every family member on my moms side as far back as we could trace), it’s also a ver common side effect of my lovely autism, and lastly I have a very rare disease that drastically effected the function of my digestive track which unfortunately means a lot of the chemical processes our bodies do are completely f’ed in my own body. So my authentic lifelong reality has always been sleep deprived, legitimately since birth. It’s so extreme that if I sleep over 7 hours I get really severe migraines, and flu like symptoms. My sleep specialist said that’s normally what happens when the average person sleeps over 24 hours almost consistently or something. My average sleeping pattern is 2-3 nights where I can’t sleep at all, then 3-4 nights with maybe 2 hours a night give or take, then *typically* between day 7-9 my insomnia will finally surrender and I’ll pass tf out for 5-7 hours. This has taken me years of very complex and intricate planning, with obnoxious amounts of trial and error. I still often have complete failure in capturing this mythical creature you all call sleep. I dread night time because it’s such an impending doom feeling and I know that even after every type of therapy and sleep specialist under the sun over 15 years, that the odds of me sleeping are so overwhelmingly stacked against me. I have very vivid memories of being 2-3 years old just quietly playing all night because I couldn’t sleep after 2-3 hours of laying there unsuccessfully. Due to my health issues I get procedures done every 3-6 months and they put me under anesthesia - I can’t explain how much I fantasize about that sensation of just “countdown from 5…” and slipping into a beautiful and sacred deep sleep. I’d trade all my vices and life pleasures for the ability to fall asleep like that naturally when I need/want to. Sleeping in new places is rough too, mostly due to c-ptsd but the change of resources and environment doesn’t help. When I was working on corporate as a high level manager, my job was very physically, emotionally, and mentally demanding and I worked a minimum of 70 hours a week (I absolutely loved it though). Sleep became so critical that I got desperate and came up with my most successful system yet (outside of pregnancy which is the holy grail 10/10 cure for my insomnia). I was ethically non-monogamous at the time and all my partners were friends and they lovingly devised a system for me and asked permission to give it a go. They asked me to smoke weed, take a relaxing long hot shower/bath which were all part of my normal process, but then one of my partners and I would have at least an hour of sex. The key was they rotated nights (like shifts) and each took a different approach to the style of sex (tantric, hypnosis, Bdsm, etc) to help me avoid the feeling of impending doom that grows as I complete each step of my sleep routines that comes with predictability. It was magical but about 2 months in it also started losing effectiveness. Sleep is by far the hardest part of my life and always has been. When I’m pregnant I sleep so perfectly and fall asleep easily wherever and whenever I want. Its the most magical thing to me haha. Learning to accept the insomnia dynamic for what it is and find the benefits has helped me start to come to peace with it. 

Now, to answer your questions as a partner. I’m two years into a monogamous committed relationship. We moved in with each other a year ago but before then I slept over at his house A LOT. I’d be lying if I said that my insomnia isn’t still a problem in our relationship sometimes but with that we’ve also gotten really creative with it. He for whatever reason was the first person in my life ever to be able to put me to sleep in under 30 minutes on a regular basis. I still to this day don’t know what it is he does or if it’s something about him or whatever but I am able to sleep more than normal. I still go more often than not with under 2-3 hours of sleep a night but the fact I have more “sleep nights” than before is a win I’m ecstatic about. That being said him being understanding and really getting to know the most vulnerable parts of my reality with this and to show empathy is a huge help in making it less lonely which more than I could dream of to begin with. It’s critical for me that he is self-aware and has effective boundaries with when he can/can’t help me and how. It always goes horrifically awry for both of us when he says he can help me fall asleep but then ends up falling asleep or whatever before I can. We’ve found that this is the biggest factor in making our relationship healthy and successful in regards to my insomnia. Things he does that helps are: • talks to me about things I don’t understand/am not interested in (he’s a mechanic and gamer so it’s usually like a car part process or a match in a game) while I lay in his lap and he plays with my hair or strokes my face. • if he is giving me touch involving motion or talking then it has to be consistent because if he suddenly stops before I’m actually asleep I’ll jolt awake and panic feeling like I ran out of time to fall asleep or something • not even subtly indicating or mentioning a time limit because it yet again gives me the countdown doom feeling • weed and good sex are almost always a win • makes sure I’ve eaten • he helps me get my blankets just right (autism sensory issues) • massages, specifically my feet • positive affirmations, reassurance and praise “you are safe”, “good, love…that’s it just close your eyes just like that, I’m right here and not leaving you. Take your time, no rush.” • if he talks me to sleep he can’t ask questions because it kicks my brain back on • we also came up with cues where I can tap him or make a certain soft sound to indicate if I need certain things to change (keeps my mind from engaging like it would if I verbally told him) • sometimes he games and I fall asleep in his lap then he moves me to bed • he sneaks in reverse psychology when I’m being bratty haha like “K don’t fall asleep” while massaging me • him learning my “love map” type things like what is sensory good/bad touch to me, noting what worked and what didn’t, etc., but particularly using these things on his own without me realizing so it just becomes this magical thing to me helps make him and our bed strong sleep associations • changing words because he realized me hearing things like “fall asleep” triggered the doom but saying “let’s go cuddle and relax” didn’t but changing it up often so they don’t become trigger phrases.

My last piece of advice is to make sure you are setting you guys both up for success. For some of us sleep is so unattainable that when we can get it, the way we got it becomes an addiction of sorts. So think of it like how people say “don’t full-send splurge on a baby’s birthday because you have to top it the next year and then top that year and so on.” Like set yourselves up for realistic long term routines. I’d also encourage finding a therapist who is creative and knowledgeable in insomnia for not only partner to see but have you see them alone too, because if you can help create a environment without partner knowing the mechanics behind the magic you may be able to support partner in evolving his sleep dynamics and patterns into something that serves you both more successfully."

In any case this is best discussed with your prescribing doc, but it would be appear these drugs aren't addressing the underlying root cause.

It's possible your true issues are nonmedical in nature, or at least have some overlap with them.  Those are most common and include bad sleep habits and excessive worry about the idea of sleep.  To treat the nonmed issues, use of a CBT sleep training system is usually very effective."
1550,hcugg40,,,insomnia,1631641247,"&gt; How can I make him feel understood and supported?

If you're asking, I'd guess you already do.

&gt; We had a conversation and he explained to me that he has to be in bed by like 10pm because it takes him hours to actually fall asleep. 

Ask him when he gets up to start his day. If he sleeps at 4 am, I would guess it's around noon? This would mean his circadian rhythm is anchored there. It would be near impossible to fall asleep by midnight if that is the case, he'd have no sleep pressure until 4 am, which is 8h before. It's basically jet lag. The only way to shift is to get up in the morning at a consistent time, get bright light exposure from the sun, and limit total time in bed. 

&gt; Any advice you would give anyone dating someone with insomnia? 

Be patient. Some insomniacs can be notoriously touchy about unprovoked advice, they project on others that they must think they don't ""try hard"" enough or that they're failures, even if that's completely untrue. You can easily communicate where you're coming from and what your concerns are. Owing to this insecurity they might embrace the idea that there is ""nothing they can do"". That's untrue, but also unfair to their partner. 

You can't solve this problem for him, but the caveat to patience on your part could be that he remain vigilant in exploring solutions and never give up, and that you will be there for him in the journey. Emotional support really helps. This can take awhile, mind you. Primary insomnia is difficult to bounce back from if it's very advanced, as it often comes paired with anxiety, stress, and other developments. It can be really hard to deal with, as insomnia in itself saps motivation and we end up seeking comfort in potentially counter-productive habits. 

Check out [this](https://insomniasos.net/) guide and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ) video. If you think they're receptive, you can try sharing it on the sly.

Would also note that sharing a bed is a disaster if his insomnia is bad, I would honestly leave that till after progress has been made so that there's no pressure."

There can be many causes for this, but esp at your age the majority of issues are nonmedical -- typically some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  Your ""freaking out"" statement suggests stress about sleep is fueling this to at least some degree.

The standard of care for that is use of a CBT sleep training system, which would give you a full substance-free solution.

Short of that you can try a couple of things right away.  One is to keep a very consistent wake time without sleeping in or napping later.  

The second is to plan a nice hour or so wind down before bed to help you de-stress and relax.  Try to go screen free and stress free.  Use in-bed relaxation methods like deep breathing to help yourself fall back asleep."

1554,hcu4q69,,,insomnia,1631636568,"Sleep maintenance is HARD!  I have it too.  Of course see a doctor to rule out sleep apnea, maybe see if your dentist mentions clenching or grinding your teeth.  These can be related or unrelated but both cause waking frequently.


A ton of doctors have told me it is very typical of clinical depression and CPTSD both of which I have but no meds have ever helped me in any way so I’m not medicated.  That said,  it might be something to explore with a psychiatrist, especially if you have past trauma.  And it can not seem like Trauma but still be traumatizing, depends on the person.  There’s a lot of ways this is starting to be treated.  What sucks is they all involve revisiting repressed emotions and doing a ton of homework between therapy appointments. I HATE it! But it works.


Part of this work was adjusting my expectations and reaction to going to bed and sleeping and waking.  I had to basically stop caring so much and I am helped by reminding myself that I’ve survived plenty of days on zero sleep and got through them 100% of the time.  This took away pressure, anxiety and frustration allowing my nervous system to chill the eff out which helps in and of itself.  Some people (I think basically everyone in the US at least) are constantly in low-level fight/flight/freeze/fawn mode.  I believe a lot of chronic insomnia and even chronic pain have been linked to this ramped-up nervous system state.  When there’s any unresolved, unexpressed emotions involved, it gets even more pronounced.  Sounds so ridiculous, I’m sure.  Check out Dr. Sarno’s work or Nicole Sachs. Look at the Curable app. Chronic pain and chronic sleep issues are 2 sides of the same coin.

Outside of that I take very low dose (0.3 mg) melatonin about 3 hours before bed based on some studies  I read and CBD capsules at the same time.  

Relaxing yoga before bed, just like 10 minutes is enough.

Wearing a black-out eye mask and earplugs changed my life.

Cut back or quit alcohol, it causes early morning waking for many people. Super common.  I limit my drinking to weekends.  I don’t binge drink on weekends either because the less I drink the less I like drinking.  Sobriety starts to feel so good and that sleep is so pure.  If you tune into how things make you feel long-term this should be easily done but if this is a struggle PLEASE see a doctor and be honest about your consumption and why you want to quit.  Don’t be embarrassed because alcohol is highly addictive and you can cause real harm to yourself quitting.  

I did all these things over years and now I can stay asleep most nights and if I can’t it’s because I’m consistently skipping exercise or journaling or something else is off."

1556,hcu164b,,,insomnia,1631635145,"Hi!  I thought I would chime in as the insomniac one between me and my boyfriend.

If you're in the same place together trying to sleep, I find it helpful just to know that my boyfriend is willing to be awake and help me get back to sleep.  It's such a trash feeling being awake next to him while he's sound-out asleep and feeling like if I try to get up and help myself, then I'll wake him up.  He and I have limits to this of course (like if he works his 6am shift, I'll probably let him sleep if I wake up/am still awake at 3am), but his assurances that he will try to help set me at ease.

When he asks me what will help in the moment, I usually say ""I don't know!""  We've defaulted to having a glass of cold water and then a mug of tea, and we'll sit up and talk.  Sometimes I have a breakdown out of frustration, but he's willing to ride it out with me.  And honestly, sometimes I barely drink the tea--it's just the process of settling back down, the warmth in my hands, and having an outlet for the sleepless energy that gets me ready to lie back.  The downside: this can take upwards of an hour to do.

I agree with what everyone else has said about letting him sleep at his place.  When I would visit with my boyfriend and sleep over, it was REALLY hard for me to sleep at night and I would end up taking extremely long naps during the day to compensate.  This worried him a lot before he understood just what I was going through.

Now we're cycling through various sleep remedies to see what helps.  YMMV, but what seems to work most often (about an 85-90% success rate for me) is two CBD edibles before bed which has been about 50mg of delta-8 I think?  Long-release melatonin also works pretty well, I seem to have about a 75% effectiveness for falling asleep.  Also Advil PM definitely kicks my butt to sleep so I'll use it if I have pain at night, but it leaves me feeling generally groggy if I don't allot 9-ish hours to sleep it off.

TL;DR: Be willing to help your partner at night if they're struggling, and just experiment with what helps fall asleep and what helps him get back to sleep in the night."
1557,hcu0p3j,,,insomnia,1631634957,"Try using wake time as your zeitgeber -- meaning set and keep that wake time very consistently without sleeping in or napping later.  Get up and get going right away.

1558,hcu0fnu,,,insomnia,1631634851,"Your experience suggests the meds aren't treating the true underlying cause for your sleep issues, which isn't all that unusual.  Treating only the symptom is problematic to say the least.

This issue is best discussed with your prescribing doc, but beware the possibility your true root issues could be nonmedical, such as bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  For that use of a CBT sleep training system is the standard of care; might be worth asking about."
1559,hcu04gr,,,insomnia,1631634728,"Hard to say from just this info, but sleep can be affected by many factors in addition to the ubiquitous stress and anxiety, including bad sleep habits, too much caffeine, excessive napping, irregular sleep schedule, etc.

1560,hctvum3,,,insomnia,1631632999,"First of all, the fact that you are here, actively seeking out a way in which to better understand your boyfriend is a brilliant sign that you are already on the right track. Insomnia is an incredibly lonely and frustrating condition to have. I have had trouble sleeping for many years, and I can tell you that it is remarkably hard to accurately express to a partner how it works, since you yourself do not know. The only things we have to go on are experiences of sleeping well in the past. which we try desperately to recreate. Insomnia is different for everyone, and since it often has no obvious cause, or the cause is impossible to resolve, it is vital that you open up a channel of communication in which he feels comfortable explaining his situation. There is no real blanket advice I can give, since everyone experiences the condition differently, but I recommend nightly routine where possible. By that I mean form a recognizable pattern within your nighttime visits that gradually wind down and end at a set time. The hope is that one of these patterns will resonate with him and allow him to form a good sleep association with those visits, along with leaving him room to properly manage his sleep hygiene. Sleeping at your house may have negative associations if he has slept poorly there in the past, or just struggles to sleep in places other than his own home.

Sleeplessness can lead to a huge amount of frustration and I worry that you may feel it is directed towards you, but I really don't think that is the case. If he gets worked up about it, and you feel it is turning into a fight, try to gently remind him that the two of you are on the same team, and allow him to direct his frustration into seeking a productive solution for the problem. Dating an insomniac is a difficult thing to do, but I can tell that you really love him and I have faith that this will pass. By being there as a supportive figure and allowing him to speak about these issues, as well as taking him at his word and trusting his experience, you are already doing a great job.

I believe that you and him will strike a balance and get past this obstacle, but until you do I wish you strength and resolve, and please tell your boyfriend that these things do get better. It took me years to find a routine that works, and it was a nightmare to find, but he can do it. Please accept these best wishes from a stranger on the internet :)"
1561,hctuezg,,,insomnia,1631632410,"I know the feeling, I had so many issues with getting proper treatment because I was brushed off for so long too. I would say be persistent even when they dismiss you and don't leave their office until you feel like they're actually addressing your concerns. 


It's too easy for them to say you need better sleep hygiene which equates to routine and practices that may or may not help. Push to be acknowledged and let them know their suggestions aren't helping. 


I finally had to raise my voice and remind my doctor that this isn't our first conversation regarding this issue and he's not the first doctor I saw about it. Hopefully Healthcare is much better there than here in America.

Eating a late dinner can also lead to overheating due to digestion. 

You're spending way too much time in bed which erodes your sleep pressure and weakens your circadian rhythm.

Sounds wishy washy but I have responded far better to ‘letting go’ of my desire to sleep or desperation to be asleep while I am in bed. 

The irony of doing so is that it can really help you to fall asleep.

My insomnia was more anxiety lead though so perhaps that’s the reason it had that affect.

A book I often recommend is ‘The Sleep Solution’ by Chris Winter. A good read for any long term insomniac!

Meditation has also helped me. I find it easier to fall asleep in the morning if I’ve been meditating regularly. 

Anyway, it sounds like you’ve tried a lot mate but I wanted to chime in because I had really bad insomnia for about 6 or 7 years and was dependent on Benzo’s for many of those. My sleep is way better now and I’m clean of the Z drugs, so there’s still hope man you just gotta find the right solution for you."
1567,hctqxtk,,,insomnia,1631630976,"&amp;#x200B;

Like your boyfriend, falling asleep can sometimes take hours for me. I have gotten that much much better, but in the past, 2 hours was common. I am actually falling asleep within 10-15 minutes now, even when not at home! (seriously feels miraculous). My real struggle is waking back up, and then struggling to get back to sleep. I may need to be in bed 10 hours in order to get 6-7 hours of sleep.

As his support person, I would want you to clearly understand that insmonia isn't usually fixable with a few ""things"" or adjustments. It has typically developed over years, with organic, psychological,  and psyiological influences.

I seriously was feeling terrible and hopeless, because I have spent years working on ""sleep hygiene"" and adjusting all sorts of little factors that articles talk about. I was feeling like I was the failure, and somehow now trying hard enough. I was doing it all...

Then I heard about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for sleep disorders. I had hope, but finding a psychologist to work with feels hard. Then I remembered the Sleepio app my health insurance offered for free last year. I don't know what it costs out of pocket, but whatever it is, I would absolutely say it is worth it. 

I not only had validation that my sleep was a hot mess (which I have known for decades, but having a system to quantify my quality and quantity of sleep and track it was empowering) but also a step by step path to improving things. (Sleepio is developed around CBT)

I started out getting a 50-60 sleepscore each night. (out of 100, reflective of how much you slept, and how restful the sleep was), and am now getting a 70-84 at night. Even when I have been away for a night. That feels like a miracle. 

As his partner, I would encourage you to support him in doing anything he can to make his sleep better. Make any accomodations you can around his sleep, because its impact on his life is so profound and constant. Do your best not to resent the time he can't spend with you because he needs to be trying to sleep. He resents it enough for both of you. It is like a weight always being dragged around, making everything harder. 

It took a while for my husband and I to get used to insomia being the third partner in our marriage."
1568,hctqwyk,,,insomnia,1631630966,"If I'm understanding, you've been getting up at 1 pm until recently. That's a pretty large shift, so you wouldn't immediately have sufficient sleep pressure by midnight to consolidate sleep. If you consistently get up in the morning (and get exposure to sunlight) you'll soon build enough sleep pressure to consolidate sleep by that hour. 

Since you're a teen, you can manage 10h straight. This varies on an individual basis. If you find you wake often or have trouble falling asleep, restrict your total time to 8h temporarily and gradually extend to what you can manage. The key is still a consistent wake time.

There's this thing called ""sleep associations"", where basically we psychologically associate our physical environment with sleeping. Babies tend to sleep very well, because they associate the bed very strongly with sleep (and that's why they hate it because they think sleep means no more play time).

Your boyfriend has a poor sleep association in your house.

On the side of understanding him, please please please please please just let him sleep wherever is more comfortable for him. There are many stories on this subreddit about people getting annoyed at how quickly their partners sleep. I know it's not your fault, but you don't want your boyfriend getting jealous of you.

And 4 hours waiting is painful. I don't think non-insomniacs can truly understand, but being alone with your destructive thoughts every night is one of the worst forms of torture I wouldn't even inflict on my worst enemy. Aside from this, being awake and trying to sleep just causes you to be more irritable and stressed.

You can try do more research on insomnia and sleep science by browsing this subreddit in your spare time. See what your boyfriend has tried and if anything works.

On being in a relationship with an insomniac, let them sleep when they want. Never pressure them, and make sure not to be too kind and make him feel bad about not being able to sleep at your place. Maybe you could try to replicate his home environment in your house better?"

You could also ask him whether he needs any help with sound-proofing his room. If he's still dabbling in possible solutions/ alleviating methods. you could find out what he's tried already, and come up with new stuff. My boyfriend gives me stuff from time to time like a really good sleeping mask, or a new OTC-medicine like THC/melatonin drops, or a calming tea/ room spray, or maybe a weighted blanket, or he recommends some sleeping app that he's researched or a white noise machine, stuff like that.

I have to admit, at first I was thrilled. I was getting the same amount of sleep that I did when I was sleeping on my original mattress. Well, last week I got the dreaded surprise: My brother-in-law noticed that I wasn't sleeping and asked me what I did wrong. So, I went and checked myself out-my sleep habits, sleeping schedules, etc., and realized that it was time for a new bed.  
  
This is one of the things that I hate to do as a consumer; shopping for anything you think will help your body get the rest it needs, only to discover later that it doesn't work. And this case is no different. If you are looking for a good, quality bedding set, I would highly recommend going with something more expensive because it will more likely give you quality and durability, unlike cheaper sets which are more prone to breakage.  
  
Now, don't go off thinking that you have to buy brand new bedding set to get a restful night's sleep. You don't have to. What you do need to do is get yourself some nice, plush memory foam pillows.

There are things that you can do to solve this problem once and for all. You can get a device called an Icy Ring that vibrates when you have fallen asleep to keep you warm and stimulate your brain. It works because it wakes you up in the morning and repeats some positive affirmations over again (like ""I am dreaming"" or ""I am awake"" etc).  
  
This is probably the best solution because it works immediately and it doesn't require any effort on your part. You can use this device whenever you feel like you can't stay asleep. Also, you can get help from a sleep disorder doctor if you think that your problem is much more serious than the Icy Ring can cure. But if you can't seem to get to sleep, don't worry.

1606,hcsmg9o,,,insomnia,1631604752,"Yes, I have practiced cbt-i/sleep restriction for around 2 years. But when the brain has hyperarousal 24/7 it overrides everything you try to do to combat insomnia."

Any sound makes it really hard for me to fall asleep. I’ll normally play a mindless game on my phone with the brightness down until I doze off to sleep. But I wake up every hour or two. This morning I woke up at 4am after having multiple nightmares and I was like wired."

How was the sleep study?"

1611,hcsi2qy,,,insomnia,1631601119,"I have chronic insomnia. I had a sleep study done that showed i have neurological sleep apnea. They also found that I had extreme difficulty going to sleep, woke up very frequently when i was sleep, and that when I slept I was just as conscious as being awake. On top of that I also have night terrors where my nightmares would continue after waking, probably because of the terrible quality of my sleep. 


I took many sleep aids including Trazadone, Lunesta, Tramadol, Ambien, etc... with varying results. I found 1 thing to give me the best sleep of my life - Indica edibles. I was 100% against drugs until my brother suggested it since he had a lot of the same issues I had. 


I'll never turn back, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me! I go to dispensaries once a month to stock up. I truly hope this is an option for you and that it helps."
1612,hcshxpg,,,insomnia,1631601009,"Ambien, 5 mg.  When you wake up, crush half with your teeth and take the half whole.  Once that's done, go urinate and then go back to bed.  

Also, try to keep the lights off.  If needed get low watt night lights for the hallway and bathroom.

Whatever you do, don't pick up a cellphone or tablet, or even a book.  At most turn on or off  a fan, and/or add/remove a blanket.

Try that for a week.  Then try weaning off the Ambien by removing the whole half of the medicine, followed a week later by removing the crushed half."
1613,hcshtek,,,insomnia,1631600915,"I use audiobooks. I have selection of 30-40 books I already know well on my phone. When I can't sleep I just listen to a book about biology or astrophysics and I use a gentle sleep timer (after 15 min, the book starts getting quieter, If you are not asleep yet, you can lightly tap the phone with your fingers to move the accelerator and it gives you another 15 min and so on). I have had nights where I kept listening for 8h straight with no sleep at all but mostly I drift away after 20 mins and I wake up 2-3 times the night. Focusing my thoughts on planets, atoms and genes is much better that replaying memories and scenarios in my head.

Edit: if you live with a partner use headphones that don't hurt your ears."

The problem with weed is that you can't dream while using it which is a major part of healty sleep. Probably not the answer you're looking for but I'd suggest dropping the weed for a while.

Just a heads up, you will likely have very intense dreams or nightmares for a week or two after quiting. I started getting more sleep about a month or so after quitting"

Set and keep your wake time every morning without sleeping in or napping later.  Over the course of several weeks, that should fully reset your body clock.  You'll then begin to feel drowsy enough for proper sleep rougly 14-16 hours later.

Consistency with sleep-wake scheduling is likely one key to fixing this."

I will try to be positive about it though, if we are negative we only make it worse! At least we try to be positive, life always looks a little bit glass half full instead of half empty, know what I mean?

Have you read the Tibetan Book of the Dead?
Or Inner Engineering by Sadhguru?
I truly believe these would change your life around for the better. At least in your experience, the way you feel about things. Your perspective!

At least we can try to change and guarantee that our bodies are being taken care off the best way we can. Change what you can, if only the way you look at it, so your days become  bit sweeter!

I find a lot of comfort in looking deeply at life, understanding the unity of things and how we are part of the whole thing! Not alone. You are not alone.

Do you know, there was this philosopher who spoke about how humans get used to living in a cave (as a metaphor for whatever life they live) scared to step out in to the blinding daylight by fear of the unknown, limiting their own growth and possibilities!

I would make sure you are not undermining yourself my friend! Personally, I can be my worse enemy... so I am just saying! Careful about how you CEO your self! Negative self talk cripples your motivation and drive. You got to believe in yourself to the end my man! I am 100000% sure you have a unique gift in you, something we all can benefit from. A piece of light. Just like many others left their light and it still shines today, you have at least the seed for that light to shine bright, for your potential to unfold! 

Many great humans suffered immensely, and out of their experience came beautiful realisations and works of art, that help with their light, millions, billions of people!

So my man, (suppose you are male) you have a lot to give, a lot to get, very good things to experience still and bad things too, like we all do. But you got to live that unique experience of yourself! No one will ever exist like you. No one. Ever. You are so rare! So precious! Nourish yourself. Love what little you have!

I would recommend you set a daily habit of meaningfully thanking, being grateful, for anything. For the next breath, for the device where you can interact with the world, for the colors, the smells, for the ones who care for you, even though they must also have their problems and issues. You can find my things to be grateful. For the clothes you wear, the food you ate. That it isn't worse! That you are still here, now! So many die each second and we still here, our families hopefully too, friends too.. it's a miracle my friend. 

Look for reasons to be grateful and heal yourself of the negativity which cripples you! You can be sick but content, you can find reasons to smile. You be a good master of yourself. Be your friend. Love yourself. Believe in yourself. Be responsible, own that shit, what ever it is. And you never give up, you hear me? You keep going. Success happens to those who fail countless times. Go fail! Let's go fail! And let's enjoy the ride... at least try. I pray and hope you can do it friend.

How are you doing?

About me, a little rant in case you are curious:

What kept me awake was some inner conflicts about women I have in my life, and how I have to decide between them. Also, some small, ego destroying, health issues non life threatening. Silly things in the grand scheme of things, but enough to take my peace away I suppose! Damn...

Today was a nice day though. Even though I only got to hang around, talk, interact, get some love and made out with the girl I am getting to know. I say even though because we already had sex and we both enjoyed it and got off from the interaction, it was nice, so.. even though because I took my blue balls home today. She is the type of person who is focusing on her career reallu aggressively, making very little time for everything else in life, including me. Messages are very few if any and very cold. Personally she is a different person. I don't know when she will come visit me again too... but it's been great in the sense I am forced to focus on myself and my career too. Opportunity to grow and mature. Damn hard though when you want to feel loved and you want to be intimate with one you appreciate at least, but you only have it when she wants. 

I could go find another girl, but I will use this opportunity for growth. Anyway... then there is another girl who would be the opposite, gave me all the attention but would expect me to lead all the time. I broke up with her for physical reasons and because I want a girl with some spark too, initiative, intelligence, drive, power!

Now I am eating my own poison as they say. I am happy yet stressed. Wanting to be with her so bad. That body god damn. And she ""is a bitch"", kisses me and caresses my jewels, to leave me there with blue balls. But you wait girl! I will no-fap this bitch ass moment. When we meet you will get the hot rod oh yeah!! And I'll save you the details of what else perverted thoughts I have about what I will do to her that day! 

I am focusing on myself, trying to follow a life of high value. That is the intent. Hard when your software is badly programmed by yourself for years... my case. Now it's tough job but I like it.

Hope you and everybody find their way

1671,hcqiazu,,,insomnia,1631565485,"This is what happens. You have nights of poor sleep. You read expert articles about how important it is to sleep, backed by doctors who get paid per visit, pharma that gets paid per pill, and journalists who write articles who get paid per click. If you don't sleep well doom is your destiny. So when you're having insomnia, it gets even worse because then you start having anxiety about your health. 

Sleep is not something that can directly be controlled. So when I ask ""How do you sleep?"" some may answer: ""close your eyes"", ""turn off lights"", ""count sheep"", ""eat a big turkey dinner"" etc. The thing is, none of those things are sleep. Sleep is something that happens to you. Not something that you make happen directly. So when you start having anxiety about sleep and the health effects, you are in the realm of anxiety land. You are no longer in the world that is going to help you sleep. Every time you focus on the negative health effects, you are only making anxiety worse. Its like feeding a monster. Would you rather feed the mean ugly scary monster with its favorite food, your attention? Or would you rather feed the nice monster who's positive, realistic, rational, and in-the-moment with is favorite food, also your attention? 

Sure there may be a grain of truth to poor sleep. More likely to develop XYZ health issue. But pretty much anything in life is going to contribute to health issues too. Everyone just gets their own cross to bear. Some people are naturally going to be fatter regardless of how good they eat due to genetics. Some people are naturally going to be more prone to depression, which also promotes bad health problems. And some people are naturally more prone to insomnia. Pick a cross, you're gunna hang from some health issues in some way, ya know? And that's what pharma does best. They find what your cross is, and do studies and write academic papers and tell you how bad your particular cross is. Then they offer you their solution. Because who wouldn't be scared shitless? 

Focus on doing what you can. I highly recommend looking into ayurvedic medicine and discovering your dosha. Insomnia is a Vata imbalance. You may be more vata prone naturally. Do other things, like eating fresh fruits and veggies, work out daily, get direct sunlight, meditate/pray, see a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy.

This is probably curable with pills, but you have to think twice before taking them. Studies were made on this, where insomniacs were attached to the computer/sensors during the night and in the morning they were asked to estimate their sleep time, most of them were wrong, because computer showed that they were sleeping much more than their estimate."

The all-nighters don't work that well because it takes more than a night to shift your circadian rhythm. Treat this like jet lag, because that's what it is: get up in the morning at a consistent time, get bright light exposure from the sun, and limit your total time in bed. Don't bother trying to go to bed ""early"", just stay up until you have enough sleep pressure. In the interim this means reduced total sleep time but that's temporary.

I normally take it for 1-2 weeks, then a break for a week. Works pretty well for me, and has prevented any serious dependence or tolerance so far, and it's been years.

I always sleep awful the first night when I first stop it, but that's not dependence on the drug. That's because I've caught up on my sleep and my body hates that.

1711,hcpk1be,,,insomnia,1631551565,"Hey,

I think the thing with meds is you have to try a few things out to find what works for your body. My personal ""wonder cure"" i.e. the only medicine that puts me to sleep for eight hours reliably is Ambien, but there are also a lot of people who really hate it. I think the med that hit the hardest for me was Mirtazapine, I slept through 14 hours so it may be of interest to you haha

A lot of antidepressants have sedating side effects and can make you inactive and drowsy during the day which could impact your sleep negatively. If you need antidepressants for reasons other than just sleeping, maybe it could be worth trying out the different route of taking an antidepressant in the morning that actually makes you more awake during the day. I've had positive experiences with Wellbutrin because it helped me being more active, which had positive effects on my sleep.

If you want to try out some over-the-counter meds first, I think cannabidiol (like e.g. the Vayy sleep spray) could be worth trying out, or antihistamines like e.g. dimenhydrinate (it's in sleep medications as well as some anti-nausea-stuff).

Also make sure your sleep situation is as comfortable as possible (nice matress, maybe a weighted blanket, soundproof room/ earplugs, a comfortable sleeping mask that blocks out any speck of light). Little noises or visual stimuli could be (partly) responsible for you missing out on deep sleep"

I never had issues with my sleep before, but then I started having anxiety and panic attacks, and that lasted for 3 weeks, and then that turned into severe insomnia where I was only sleeping for 1-2 hours a night for a few days. I couldn't take it anymore and went to the doctor and got on zoloft. My anxiety has went down, and my sleep has improved a little bit, but it's still really poor compared to a few months ago. I've been on this medicine for almost 5 weeks now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking I might need to take a sleeping medicine to help my sleep. I heard good things about trazodone. Will that help me stay asleep? Or does it only help you fall asleep initially? I need a good medicine that will help me stay asleep, if that's even possible."

1728,hcp0ugp,,,insomnia,1631543583,"I'm afraid it's a little more complicated than that. While it's true that vivid dreaming is most likely to occur during REM sleep and that deep sleep comes before REM sleep, two points are important here:

* Sleeping doesn't mean moving through the sleep stages once. Your body is meant to cycle through all stages of sleep several times per night. (Towards morning, REM-stages take longer and longer, which is why you're more likely to have memories of vivid dreams before waking up)
* The time it takes for an individual sleep stage to pass can vary a *lot*. Reaching REM-sleep can take anywhere between 30 and 120 minutes per cycle - that is, if you assume that your sleep stages aren't messed up. So if you have one memory of a dream, it could mean you've only had around 10 minutes of proper deep sleep which of course is far too little.

That being said, you can be assured that you've managed to catch a little more deep sleep than that if you sorta remember the time were you went to sleep. Like, if you remember getting kinda tired around 11 pm and waking up around 5 pm, it's safe to assume you've probably cycled through the sleep stages a few times. Basically, the good news is that yes, you probably got some deep sleep, and the bad news is that it could still be that you're still wildly sleep-deprived.

But the gist of your post is kinda right - if you're dreaming, then you've slept and you likely had at least a little portion of deep sleep, and that's always better than nothing.

And lastly, you can always learn to live with insomnia! No matter how little deep sleep you get at the moment, there are so many methods and approaches to try that have the potential of making your life a lot (or at least, a little) easier!"

As for long-term affects, there is a link between insomnia and dementia in later life. Though, the link is just correlative, so there's no way to be sure if insomnia actually causes dementia.

1768,hco5ln4,,,insomnia,1631524169,"I went through several years of this starting at about age 17 and carrying on until I was 25, didn’t fully become under control until 28 (now 29f). The major difference, however, was that I was chronically exhausted from this. My depression and anxiety become crippling. I just had no shut off switch for my brain though and could never sleep which created a cycle of sleep stress that just intensified everything. 

For whatever reason the first 10+ sleep meds weren’t enough for me. They’d either be entirely ineffective or I’d need huge doses (things like benzodiazepines and z-drugs) which made me feel bad the next day and I grew a tolerance extremely quickly compared to “normal” people. 

Every quetiapine did help though. I need a very high dose which wasn’t ideal but it did make me sleep most nights without me ever building a tolerance. It did not make the underlying causes better though. 

With all that said, I’ve found medication that has gotten my depression to the best place I’ve ever been in my life. I always failed on antidepressants and other meds until then. That’s what actually “cured” my insomnia. I went from taking 300mg of quetiapine at night with a 75% success rate to take less than 25mg with a 99% success rate. 

The point of this ramble is, I wish I had treat the cause of my insomnia sooner rather than continuing to treat the symptom, i.e., the insomnia itself. My life is markedly better now and I sleep without stress. 

I wish you all the luck. I know the hell you’re experiencing."

The vivid dreams are actually a good sign, in that the REM dream stage is typically preceded by the deeper, more important NREM stages.  That suggests you're experiencing some robust, quality sleep.  Furthermore, you're processing something in those dreams -- that could and is likely related to the daytime stress and generalized anxiety you are experiencing.

Providing you're not experiencing fatigue or excessive drowsiness from sleep deprivation, you might consider it better to be processing out the stress/anxiety in your dream world than in reality."

1806,hclr9ua,,,insomnia,1631476961,"First off, you don’t have fatal insomnia, so no need to freak out. However, you definitely need to get that anxiety addressed because it is certainly not helping you get better. Second, cut out the phone and TV thing. It’s actively perpetuating the cycle. Third, go to a doctor for help with this if you can. It is interfering with your ability to function at a basic level, so you need to get assistance with it.

In terms of things that can help, it sounds like it might be worth it to try a weekend (or even longer if possible) camping trip. Don’t use your phone during this time, *especially not at night*. Bring lots of books and other things to do. You could even try sleeping in a tent/hammock in the back yard for a week or more to help you kickstart your recovery and reset your circadian rhythm.

1808,hclnzgs,,,insomnia,1631475678,"Same thing happened to me. I had most of the symptoms, could barely sleep for more than 4 hours, always had hypnic jerks when trying to sleep. I tried forgetting about it, but i can't. The only effective solution that i found is to just accept it. One of the main causes of insomnia is anxiety. Why do you feel anxious? 'Cause you fear that you might have it. Or that you don't want to die a slow death, like you said. How about try accepting the fact that you will die a slow and painful death? or try to accept that you do have a fatal insomnia. If you do have it, do you want to spend your remaining time in this world in constant fear and anxiety? 

I know it's not easy. Always dreading the time when you'll have to try to sleep again. I have experienced exactly what you're experiencing. And trust me, it won't be pleasant. But you see, no matter how many times you receive an advice, like this one, it all depends on what you'll do. 

Just think about this, if you were able to sleep last night, or the night after that, then the chances of you having it is slim. It's probably just because of your anxiety that you are having a hard time sleeping. 

Dunno if any of things that i said helped, but i hope it did. Or atleast gave you an idea on what you should do. Hang in there =)

PS: One of the reasons why you can't sleep earlier than 6-7 am is probably because your body has grown accustomed that that is when you'll go to sleep. One of the method that i do to try and change my sleeping schedule is for example, i slept at around 6am then the next day i'll try to sleep at 5am, and just do it consistently. You can also pull an all-nighter, but it's not a good idea, honestly, since it only worsens your anxiety. Avoid using any gadgets 10-20 mins before sleeping. Just get comfortable and try to sleep. If it doesn't work then get up, then after 15-25 mins try again. I'll stop now since this is getting ridiculously long."
1809,hclnxz7,,,insomnia,1631475661,"Yep, I took therapy on insomnia treatment and it was basically their rule number 1. Sleeping better by spending less time in bed sounds counterintuitive but my mind really made the click quickly. If you try this, make sure to do something calm that you like though, like reading or watching a lazy show. Be nice to yourself, don't try to spend the time ""useful"" and work/study, that might just stress you out in different ways.

When I had these minor successes, it helped me to control my anxiety at least to a level I'm not suffering nightly panic attacks anymore.

Good luck and keep trying! Don't give up, keep digging, try different methods, analyze what helps and what doesn't. I hope you get lots of restful sleep in your future :)"

Once u have insomnia is hard to get rid of it, especially if u suffer from it long time

And in my case the underlying issue is hard to find it seems, but i do have anxiety so thats also a big cause of my insomnia atm, and i do believe that if u suffer long enough from insomnia  that it is creating more problems like getting more depressed, so u started w maybe 1 problem but in the end u have much more.. cz insomnia mess everything up if its not getting cured and it goes on for too long

Yes also jealous of the ppl that always sleep good and can sleep at any time they want, cz if i sleep too late after a certain time than i cant sleep normal anymore and get max only 4hrs cz always wakeup too early and cant fall back asleep again, the insomnia caused this it really sucks
And yh also dont like to use meditcation i feel thats not the solution maybe only for a short time but if u have anxiety u have to be careful w sleep medications bcz if u taking it and lets say it helps u “sleeping better” than if u dont take it u get more anxiety that u cant sleep without it anymore 
Anw i hope we ever get cured from this insomnia cz im so tired of it"

Doesn't really work well because it takes more than a day to shift. You won't be able to head to bed ""early"" if your circadian rhythm is anchored way further ahead, you'll have no sleep pressure, just fatigue. The key to shifting schedules is to get up at a consistent time in the morning, expose yourself to bright light from the sun, and just stay up until you get enough sleep pressure. Treat it like jet lag, because it is.

I've already pulled some strings last Friday and I'm taking the rest of the semester off with no real harm to my grades. I'm incredibly grateful that they've done this for me, so I'm going to take the time to focus on my mental health."
1855,hckhgso,,,insomnia,1631458396,"I think the problem can be solved through 3 vectors - general lifestyle behaviors, ""bridging"" behaviors between wakefulness and going to bed, and/or what you do in bed. Keep in mind I think ultimately these issues change from person to person, so employing an experimental mindset helps. 

* **general lifestyle.** Get 30 minutes of natural sunlight as soon as you wake up (hopefully your PT is outside). Theres a few studies that correlate it to better sleep in general, but for me it specifically caused me to pass out significantly faster when my head hit the pillow. Other things that helped were paying attention to light. Getting more light during the day, getting less screen light at night. I use blue light blockers on my phone and computer. But some people say it's not the light so much as the stimulation  - interesting shows, rabbit holes of internet research, a never-ending social media program, etc. Black out curtains got me to bed faster and deeper but gave me groggy wake's. One thing to try might be black out curtains and a light alarm.
* **bridging activities.** They say that certain activities, like stretching or mobilizing, can start to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and get you into a calmer state for bed. I personally never experienced this, but my thoughts feel a lot more calmer when I do pranayama practices. I also feel calmer with lavender essential oils (and conversely feel more awake with any citrus essential oils). The best thing for me is anything that promotes low stakes creativity. Shitty art nights, bad stream of consciousness journaling or using writing prompts. The key is to disengage the inner editor and get into a creative flow - so, keep the pen moving, don't correct mistakes, move on any time you have a block. There's this study that stuck jazz musicians while they were improvising in fMRI machines and found their brains resembled sleep. Similarly, there's a method called ""serial diverse imaging"" that seeks to do something similar - you can [read about it here](https://bulletproofmusician.com/difficulty-getting-to-sleep-try-serial-diverse-imaging-a-crafty-way-to-trick-your-brain-into-going-to-sleep/#continue) (there's also an app). Subjectively I found that my shitty art nights get me to bed faster, rather than the revenge bedtime procrastination I normally engage in.
* **while sleeping**. This is by far what is probably the most subjective. I tried a whole host of meditation and visualization techniques. I found some, like vipassana, actually got me more awake. Some, like the 61 points yoga Nidra practice, worked but primed me for incredibly vivid dreams that weren't really restful. One, observing of my own sense of self, knocks me right out. That involves applying vipassana ""noting"" techniques on: the subtle sensations of a viewer, normally located behind my eyes peering out, or images of myself, or a sense or reaction to phenomenon. That's probably just for me, the key is understanding that you can't just try one technique and then say no meditation works - they definitely have different effects.

As an aside, while melatonin and other drugs might get you to sleep, many people (including myself) don't get great sleep on it. Sleep onset latency is different than sleep quality, and ideally you want improvement in both."

It’s a struggle every night. I now worry about sleep all day long and dread the evenings. I know I need to explore different treatment options.

Get a nightly sleep routine ASAP. That’s one of the top things to promote healthy sleep. No matter what, having the same bed time and wake up time is important, otherwise your body is constantly unsure of when it’s supposed to rest, fall asleep, and get deep sleep. Going to bed at 7-8pm and sleeping until 2 or 3pm is crushing your sleep. You’re getting like 20 hours of rest (on the days you can sleep). That’s horrible for your circadian rhythm. Go to bed at 8 or 9pm and force yourself to wake up at 6am everyday.

If the program is through anything insurance sponsored I can see why they would 'require' scripts.

But CBT-I is basically a cognitive guide on getting to sleep. Tells you what you can do to improve sleeping conditions with things like:

\-Stop using screens at least 1 hr before bed. Let your eyes and mind rest  
\- Make sure your room is cool, dark, and without noise like ticking clocks if that bothers you.  
\- Don't use your bed for anything other than sleep and sex: If you can't sleep and are tossing and turning for over 10 minutes get up and go do a sleepy activity like reading or some mindful body scans until you are tired again.  
\- Don't eat anything more than a light snack after 8PM  
\- Keep a schedule: wake up at the same time every day including weekends. Go to bed the same time every night including weekends.  
\- Keep drugs and drinking to a minimum.

1882,hcjw5rn,,,insomnia,1631447107,"It may be worth talking to a counsellor or doctor (your uni (are you in university, or high school?) should offer mental health counselling) about your insomnia, but also about anxiety. You're not sleeping well partially because you're overloaded with tasks and things to manage, and partially because you're too anxious about them; this anxiety is seriously affecting your life. This kind of thinking is sometimes called 'rumination.' I can't diagnose you over the internet, but I can tell you that you probably need to do something about the worrying before the sleep can be fixed.

In the short term, maybe try a 'brain dump' before you go to bed. Make a note of all the stuff that's worrying you and, if there's something you can do about it tomorrow, write it down too. You could also try taking voice recordings or typing. That way you know you have a 'game plan' for tomorrow. I know that when I lie in bed thinking about something I have to do, part of it is worries that if I don't keep thinking about it, I'll have forgotten by tomorrow morning; if I write it down, and put the page away, my brain feels more able to let it go.

You could also try sleep podcasts. You play them in bed and they fade out very slowly so that they won't wake you up when you're asleep, but when you're lying there your brain has something else to focus on than worrying. Some of them are meditation-esque, some of them are stories or chatter--there's a range.

Another thing you could try is just... getting out of bed if you can't sleep. Set a time where if you're not asleep by then, if you're still lying there worrying, you just get out of bed and go do something else with a timer going for like half an hour. Not something related to your worries, something fun but not super intellectually demanding, like reading or watching TV or knitting or w/e; maybe make a small snack or hot drink. Then when the timer goes, you go back to bed. Sometimes you've got to do that for a couple days for your brain to get on board, but the idea there is that 1. you interrupt the cycle of worrying, instead of fuelling it, and 2. you get your brain to associate going to bed a little less with misery and more with actually falling asleep."

1884,hcjvb8q,,,insomnia,1631446495,"Google hypnagogia, it’s an altered state of consciousness between being awake and asleep. 
Your anxiety is part of your subconscious and so when you’re tired and start falling asleep and make it past the first stage where your conscious is asleep and then because you’re anxious it keeps your subconscious active so you’re sort of asleep but sort of awake. You can try watching something before going to bed until you can’t keep your eyes open anymore and then go straight to bed because it essentially turns off your brain watching tv."
1885,hcjtlpm,,,insomnia,1631445255,"Have you tried an antidepressant, such as lexapro?  The root cause may be anxiety.  Talk to a doctor.  Antidepressant may help if you like to use medicine.  There are side effects at the beginning.

1886,hcjt7ct,,,insomnia,1631444960,"You can get a light box (or a SAD lamp) that replicates sunlight to help make up some of the benefits of daylight. Vitamin D helps a lot as well.

The best thing is just to find a sleep schedule that works for you and stick to it every day, even weekends. Take a low dose (&lt;1 mg is best, but the lowest you can find will work) of melatonin a couple hours before bed to trigger “night” for your circadian rhythm.

You could also do two shorter sleeps or try a nap at some point during the day (but make sure you keep that consistent sleep schedule).

I have to be honest, though, if your natural circadian rhythm reverts to a 5 am sleep time, trying to work completely opposite your natural schedule is going to be difficult and mentally/emotionally taxing.

Also, have you looked into delayed sleep phase? It’s a circadian rhythm disorder where the body natural sleeps and wakes at a time much later than the ‘normal’ times. If your 5 am sleeps are a result of circadian rhythm and not just sleep habits, that could be your issue."

another theory could be that throughout your day, your mind ISN'T busy enough. whenever it's the holidays or my schedule is cleared, i get really bad brain fog and a wandering mind. don't leave yourself alone with your thoughts, never. the devil finds work for the idle, always preoccupy yourself with productive activities.

i like to put on soft river white noise before sleeping, uphold my sleep hygiene, and others might find meditation helpful. the most important thing though is to realise you are prioritising matters in your life over yourself.

i think it stems from an issue where your personality is self-sacrificial. you care more about others than yourself. because of this, you end up thinking about other stuff and lack the selfishness required to just cease those thoughts and hurry up and sleep.

are you the type of person to wake up in the night from a message notification, like from someone asking help for a math question? would you answer their question and explain it well, or just say sorry i'm in bed now i'll msg you tomorrow?

1907,hcj91jc,,,insomnia,1631428818,"After many years of chronic insomnia I just couldn't go on any more. However, I had a house, job, wife and kids so I had to do something to preserve my life so I could go on. 

Out of desperation I entered a psych unit of a hospital after telling them I overdosed on sleeping pills. They admitted me because they assumed I was suicidal, but I wasn't. I just needed to be away from everything because my insomnia had beaten me down. This also saved my job because if I was out on medical leave they would not fire me. 

I kept telling the doctors and nurses that I could not sleep and had suffered from insomnia for years. They tried many different medications on me. The initial meds did not work well, but they kept trying different ones because they could not release me in the condition I was in. Eventually, they found a med that was highly effective for me and I began sleeping like a baby.

I was on this med for many years and eventually built up a tolerance so over the next few years the dosage has to be slowly increased. Once I reached what I deemed to be my maximum dosage, my doctor added a second med and once again everything stabilized and stayed that way for 26 years. Then, those two meds weren't enough. They were still working but not well enough. Then my doctor added a third med and everything has been largely stabilized again for the last five years.

I've been lucky that when a med has needed to be added or changed I get a nice long run of effectiveness and stabilization of my sleep. At my age, I assume that I will be on meds for the rest of my life and I came to accept that a long time ago. I never would have survived this long (decades) with the meds.

I don't know how the healthcare system works in the UK, but have you ever considered pulling out all the stops like I did decades ago by signing yourself into a psych unit and putting the doctors in the position of throwing everything they have at your insomnia until you can get stabilized sleep? I mean, if you can get into a top notch place with the best medical sleep doctors trying everything and anything there would have to be a fair chance of a positive outcome. I didn't know that the psych unit could actually help me as I knew nothing about sleep medications at all, so I was so happy when they finally found something that really worked for me. Have you ever considered giving up this lone fight by signing this over to a medical team that would be responsible for getting you well? It really did happen for me. Again, you would need to find out how to qualify for admittance for this type of help in the UK, but perhaps this would be worth a try."

1910,hcj7sbk,,,insomnia,1631427900,"Antihistamines have a long half-life in your system. It takes your body a long time to eliminate them. It could even be a full day for some people. That means you could be drowsy most of the next day. If it's just the morning for you, that's normal.

When I take them, I can feel their effects for about 18 hours, which is one reason I don't like them much."

I watched Netflix to distract my mind until the anxiety faded and I felt sleepy, then tried again to sleep.  It helped a lot after 3 nights, and it helped me to control my anxiety better. The idea is to not lie awake and stressed in bed so your mind stops connecting your bed to misery, and starts seeing it as a place you go to sleep.

I still struggle with anxiety and stress and have bad nights, for days or sometimes weeks, but it's less bad and I feel like I have a life again."

It got so bad I would have anxiety attacks just.going to bed and every morning I wanted to end my existence. .the anxiety was so bad because of it.  

Eventually it culminated with me telling my boss my situation and that if he had a problem with it I'd have my office packed up by the end of the day.  I'm a good engineer and he backed down.  Eventually things got better and now we have an understanding and my sleep is so much better these days and my anxiety is subsequently much lower.  

It also helped that I had a note from my psych allowing me a flexible start time.  I didn't have to use it but my boss backed down a.bit knowing that I had it.  

Hopefully your place.is.more.understanding than mine.  Insomnia isn't taken seriously by people until they've dealt with it themselves.

Insomnia has always been an issue for me and I still have it from time to time but this new job actually fulfills me and gives me more structure, even though I wake up at 4:30am and won’t be home before 5pm. Yeah, weekdays are short and occasionally it feels like living for the weekend only but in general I think it was the right choice.

You mentioned your mental health, which I think should always be the number one criterion. If the job feels rewarding and interesting, give it a good try, adjusting to a new sleep rhythm is absolutely doable and isn’t so hard because of all the new impressions which tend to consume quite a bit of energy. At the end of the first couple days you’ll be tired from just processing all that input.
If it’s a job you don’t enjoy though and that you only took for the money (understandable) it’ll only exhaust you more and in the long term won’t do you any good. For a limited time, just to make some money, yeah maybe, but I’d try to find something that’s at least worth making all the adjustments."

1953,hchh43q,,,insomnia,1631396625,"it doesn't make your body stop producing melatonin lmao, or reduce its own production. your body makes an insane more amount of melatonin naturally that these supplements will never reduce. they are a boost, not any chance to reduce. you can have too much melatonin in your system at the wrong times of your melatonin cycle in your circadian rhythm, which would cause sleeplessness.

sometimes you gotta go up mg. melatonin won't kill you, take up to 6000mg you'll be groggy but fine. low dosages are recommended but some take 10, 15 mg. also try takin .5 to 5 mg 2-6 hours before bed time or 12 hours before wake time. light exposure after wake up PLUS melatonin 2-6hours before has been studied to be a more impactful regime"
1954,hchfup6,,,insomnia,1631396103,"light exposure works much more significantly than melatonin, for MOST. light PLUS melatonin for most works even better. melatonin alone might work a lil, but it does a better job of freezing the rhythm your in (for whatever disorder it is)"
1955,hchfh30,,,insomnia,1631395945,"maybe r/dspd but if it's temporary maybe not, either way same principles apply. your goal should be LIGHT exposure, sunlight or light glasses, when you wake up, &amp; preferably at natural wake time but since you gotta do what you gotta do, when you wake at 7 a.m. or whatever you have to now, try to get sunlight for 30 mins to 1 hour at least, &amp; take melatonin 2-6 hours before you sleep"
1956,hchf4ee,,,insomnia,1631395803,"tho you may not have it if its temporary or you're teenager still, follow advice on r/DSPD on how to advance your sleep schedule 

easiest is 1-2 or more hours of sunlight or light therapy glasses at your natural wake time or whatever time you're at now, and a .5 -  5mg of melatonin 1-2 hours or 5-6 hours before your natural sleep time, or 12 hours before your target wake time."
1957,hchenp6,,,insomnia,1631395608,"uhhhh it sounds maybe like delayed sleep phase disorder r/DSPD or non-24 r/N24

either way. light to advance sleep, melatonin to freeze, light + melatonin + dark therapy to advance even more. generally. light at your natural wake time impacts more than alarm clock wake, but if no choice, light when you wake is good. but tbh don't do chronotherapy (advancing your sleep each day by X hours) it isn't proven to work in any study by anyone serious &amp; takes a lotta work to actually even maintain short term. 

evening sunlight doesn't matter either, poster's here are rather uhhh ignorant. evening sunlight is actually worse cuz it's barely even enough LUX, as opposed to morning or midday. &amp; the setting matters to. download LUX app, see if you're gettin 3,000 to 10,000 lux in daylight or from screens. but sunlight unimpeded for 1-2 hours or light therapy glasses when you wake will have a good chance of movin your sleep schedule forward, if you have DSPD"

1986,hcgimoj,,,insomnia,1631382032,"There are some connections. Sometimes an intestinal inflammation syndrome causes cortisol and histamine to rise due to immune responses, which can hinder falling asleep.

Mananging these with probiotics, oregano + olive oil capsules (6 per day), and peppermint + nettle teas, with some apple cider vinegar, my ability to fall asleep quickly drastically improved.

However, since 2 weeks there is some serious sleep maintenance issue.

Coincidentally, I gained 5 kilos of weight and have massive stretch marks on the belly and arms (as a 22 y/o guy lol) - typical signs of way too high cortisol.

Now I'm trying to supplement 3 mg of tyrosine daily, along with some dishes containing iodine salt.

Since I have phenylketonuria and thus may lack monoamine oxidase A due to low tyrosine synthesis, besides being vegetarian and thus getting low tyrosine and rare replenishing amounts, which makes aggressive, impulsive, and mentally hyperactive, serotonin may not be broken down.

The results may be mania, stuff as said, and (get ready):

An overactive HPA-axis. Too much cortisol secretion.

So that's my relatively harmless experiment for the next 2 weeks.

But if that doesn't work, we won't let you run out like that again."" I could've cried."
1995,hcg7hal,,,insomnia,1631377213,That's so great that your doctor works with you. I'm glad it works!
1996,hcg7c9o,,,insomnia,1631377152,A lot of people have mild insomnia they just don't care and don't have any underlying issues like anxiety or other mental illnesses so they just don't talk about it
1997,hcg73v4,,,insomnia,1631377049,Yes. Sleeping that little is actually dangerous to your body.
1998,hcg6w03,,,insomnia,1631376953,"I've been on it for 6 years and it's worked all this time. 1 mg most nights, and the only side effects I get are when I can't get into my doc for a refill and I get bad anxiety. I realize is a physical dependency now, but my new doctor is more than happy to keep me from running out again."
1999,hcg6jda,,,insomnia,1631376800,That's good to hear. Just keep an eye out for those dissociating effects. It's been 1.5 months off it and it's still not gone away for me!
2000,hcg5tiv,,,insomnia,1631376483,Good luck
2001,hcg5o54,,,insomnia,1631376419,"Normally recovery from sleep deprivation is relatively fast, but it's also possible that your inconsistent sleep schedule is part of the issue.  Given your med history if this continues you'd be well advised to discuss with your doc."
2002,hcg54de,,,insomnia,1631376183,I have not. I'll have to try it
2003,hcg3jts,,,insomnia,1631375509,"I don't have that effect with Xanax. I don't even stay awake long enough after taking it to experience the ""high"" from it. Just nice, easy sleep and I wake up normal and functional."
2004,hcg36gq,,,insomnia,1631375347,"if you can, connect a bluetooth speaker to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyh0aaJo9Nc) , it's a high frequency sound that dogs hate, this is in it for the long haul, but if you can time it during the day, and get the dog to associate barking with that sound, perhaps he will stop. godspeed if you do choose to engage in this line of psychological warfare. i would speak to your neighbors about this if you can as well. just be cordial. i have had friends who have the lectrofan as mentioned below as well."
2005,hcg2zlv,,,insomnia,1631375266,"Is it possible you can switch to klonopin, which is another benzo? After taking a small tiny dose of xanax for sleep for a few months, I have become ... it's like my reality is teo dimensional. Like I dont even feel alive and I'm struggling to feel like I'm even present. Klonopin never did that though. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone... 
Also, have you tried dayvigo? Belsomra didnt work for me but dayvigo was way better, even at just 2.5mg."
2006,hcg2dze,,,insomnia,1631375006,"I feel like belsomra doesnt work for me, but Dayvigo is pretty powerful. Like I would even just take 2.5mg and it works. Have you tried that?"
2007,hcg1hpv,,,insomnia,1631374613,Yeah but it sounds like sleep isn't his only problem and he takes those other medicines for his other issues.
2008,hcg1agi,,,insomnia,1631374522,Is that why my stomach hurts ?
2009,hcg0j5l,,,insomnia,1631374183,"Yeah, imo it's better to take a single sleep med that works (perhaps a z-drug), than several psych meds to achieve the same result but with way more side effects."
2010,hcfyst8,,,insomnia,1631373427,"15-20 most nights. did a sleep study and tried everything under the sun. it's just something I live with now. not trying to diminish your issues, just trying to give perspective for you.

also no one sleeps through the night, 2-3x is standard. the 20-45m is not, but if your body only needs 7 hours and you're trying to sleep for 9, you're not going to sleep soundly the whole time."
2011,hcfxwl0,,,insomnia,1631373035,"15 different medicines? wow, that's extreme. Many medicines can cause insomnia. Sometimes less is better. I'd definitely find a better psychiatrist."
2012,hcfvd2z,,,insomnia,1631371916,"When do you get in and out of bed, i.e. total time in bed?"
2013,hcfva9j,,,insomnia,1631371883,LectroFan noise machine can get loud
2014,hcfv61v,,,insomnia,1631371833,try [this](https://insomniasos.net/) guide
2015,hcfu334,,,insomnia,1631371341,"Thanks for the suggestions! I am currently on 100 milligrams of zoloft and 3 milligrams of Klonopin. My current psychiatrist pushes too many medications on me. I think I'm on 15? I really don't remember. 


Anyways, I am currently looking for a new psychiatrist with my current sleep Psychologist, hoping to find a good one."
2016,hcftlwi,,,insomnia,1631371113,I'm going to take a trip to the normal hospital after I eat a bagel. I called a friend up who lives in the area to drive me. I'll hopefully be fine.
2017,hcft77j,,,insomnia,1631370920,I didn‘t really realise when exactly it stopped but it was gone late july-ish. So about three month.
2018,hcfsr7d,,,insomnia,1631370714,Have you tried thick rubber mats under bed legs?
2019,hcfqfjk,,,insomnia,1631369586,"Sucks and I feel for ya. You gotta accept it and trust that you will get back into a routine the next night. I'm going through a bad streak right now and am focusing on getting through the day, one hour at a time."
2020,hcfqahx,,,insomnia,1631369517,"Glad it worked, according to literature it's supposed to work (mast cell regulation and GABA synthesis).

Now try that with irritable bowel syndrome, where you need 4 fold magnesium and 40 whole ass milligram of B6, and then meet even more inflammation ;_;"
2021,hcfq4f0,,,insomnia,1631369431,"Ah yes, the story of my life~"
2022,hcfoyri,,,insomnia,1631368834,"Both important. Light has a huge impact on our circadian rhythms, it's not just for synthesizing vitamin D."
2023,hcfmrmx,,,insomnia,1631367694,melatonin 5-12mg may be too high.  I took it at 5 mg.  It worked the first few weeks but not more.  Other people in Internet say we should take 0.3-0.5 mg only.  Otherwise it can make sleep worse.
2024,hcflcua,,,insomnia,1631366931,Go to a normal hospital asap.
2025,hcfk4w3,,,insomnia,1631366265,"Only sometimes Oxazepam but only 5mg or even less, i dont want to take it everyday only when i cant fall sleep at all and for me it only work to sleep in but not to keep me asleep, im actually kinda against medication but when im in a desperate state i try things but i dont feel good taking pills tbh i want to sleep natural but is hard"
2026,hcfjuo6,,,insomnia,1631366107,"Yeah, I'm on zoloft and also have insomnia. I've only been taking it for a little over 4 weeks so I'm hoping it will go away eventually. It's gotten better, but still not 100%."
2027,hcfi73f,,,insomnia,1631365182,"mental hospital? why not just see a normal psychiatrist? I was having bad anxiety and panic attacks for over 3 weeks and then that progressed into severe insomnia where I was only sleeping 1-2 hours a day. I remember waking up after 1 hour and I was like shivering like it was cold but it wasn't. I felt like I was going crazy and couldn't take it anymore so I went to a psychiatrist. He put me on zoloft and klonopin. Zoloft is an antidepressant that helps with anxiety and depression. Klonopin is an anti anxiety medicine that also helps you sleep, though it's not for long term use because you can become dependent  and the withdrawals are horrible. I took that for about 2 weeks. Today is day 31 on Zoloft and I'm feeling much better, though still not 100% yet, though it takes 6 weeks to feel the full effect. My sleep has improved, but it's still not 100% perfect, but I've researched insomnia a lot and I've implemented different techniques to help me sleep better. It's way better now and I'm starting to take control of my life again. I never wanted to go on medicine before and tried to do things the all natural way, but it wasn't working and I had no other choice because of how much I was suffering. I'm fortunate that my town has this free mental health place that I didn't have to pay anything for. I don't have insurance or a job or anything. I'd make yourself an appointment"
2028,hcfi72f,,,insomnia,1631365182,I tried staying awake until 10:30 PM then turning every single source of light off until you wake up naturally and keep doing this and if you cant fall asleep stay up for the whole time until 10:30 PM the next day and the next day and keep doing it until I could and I guess it works for me
2029,hcfecce,,,insomnia,1631362885,Do you take medication for it or you just deal with it?
2030,hcfcze8,,,insomnia,1631362001,"No. This is a first time for me. All this situation. The ambien is just the first step, the first try. My doctor said to call back Monday after the weekend to update him on the results. But yeah, ambien did nothing. I was up wide awake and being productive and getting things done. The bigger problem is pinpointing why I can't fall asleep and what triggered this episode. The other thing is I do have occasional spouts of getting up early at like 4 am full of energy that I naturally assumed was my ADHD but they come and go and I haven't ran into any sleep problems until now."
2031,hcfbt2h,,,insomnia,1631361212,"Yea, I am experiencing the exact same thing."
2032,hcfbg1h,,,insomnia,1631360964,"It does help with anxiety , that’s why it’s prescribed for sleep and anxiety also , and it works ! But it’s an antihistamine, like Benadryl , sleep and anxiety are the reasons other than allegories that they prescribe it , it’s commonly prescribed now for those reasons , you would have no problem getting it because it’s not a drugs of abuse"
2033,hcfavac,,,insomnia,1631360571,"I have insomnia from years of drug abuse. In my case I agree I'll never get my sleep back to the way it was before. It's so easy when I was younger, I just wish I knew how precious my sleep would be to be when I got order."
2034,hcf9b3s,,,insomnia,1631359503,"I miss the mornings when i use to wake up rested feeling good, where is now i feel so tired everyday to get out bed and start the day with no energy and i miss falling asleep at any time, many yrs ago i was such a good sleeper i always loved sleeping so much now its only stress for me"
2035,hcf93r1,,,insomnia,1631359360,Have you tried seroquel? It’s the only thing that would ever give me unimpeded sleep after trying about 15 other medications. Ambien also has horrible side effects because of all of the interactions it has with certain neurotransmitters. Seroquel doesn’t carry the same risks and doesn’t play with emotions although it can leave you really hungover if dosed too high.
2036,hcf8iuc,,,insomnia,1631358949,"I’ve struggled with insomnia for as long as I can remember, but I was able to sleep enough to stay present. However this past summer about 4 months ago I adopted a 3 days up 1 day asleep schedule. I know it is not to your degree, but over the last two months it’s caught up to me. At times I think I’m going crazy, I’m more depressed than ever, and I feel lost in the world. 
So I do feel for you man, but there has to be an answer! I am not fond of pharmacology, but there are certain rare cases that require it. Have you ever tried Seroquel, or amitriptyline? Amitriptyline was the only thing to ever work for me in the past after trying about 15 other sleep meds. it has slight SSRI qualities which did help with my mood and seroquel was the only thing to really knock me out when my insomnia was being a real b**** 
I’m actually going to start back up on one of the two and if you haven’t tried these before I’d recommend you give them a shot. Wishing you the best 👍"
2037,hcf6y11,,,insomnia,1631357733,"Yeah same insomnia makes me depressed and i wasnt a depressed person before, i do have thoughts like “this is no life” and “i do be happy if life is over so i dont suffer anymore from this” but not in a suicidal way like i would never end my life but if ur insomnia is really bad its not weird to have these kind of thoughts"
2038,hcexfct,,,insomnia,1631349469,"Yeah true most ppl dont take it really serious if u say u dont sleep enough etc, they think is not that bad..they have no idea how it is. i even end up not talking abt it much anymore cz the ppl that sleep good always dont get it anyway"
2039,hcewzp4,,,insomnia,1631349079,Yeah is weird even seeying so many people on reddit having insomnia than i still feel kinda alone in this cause irl the people i know sleep all well and thats what u see daily and if ppl (irl) ask me how come u dont sleep etc Than it makes feel even more lonely bcz they cant understand it really how it is and why
2040,hcew86s,,,insomnia,1631348382,"my first piece of advice is to sleep in a position that won’t cut of circulation to your arms, maybe starfish sleeping position might benefit you. the way i deal with my dreams is with weed, if i’m lightly stoned before bed i won’t remember my dreams (most of mine are ptsd related). sleeping in my back makes me more conscious of my dreams so i try to avoid sleeping on my back"
2041,hcevywu,,,insomnia,1631348145,"I would get cold sweats, body shakes, and extreme anxiety which affected my sleeping."
2042,hcevv78,,,insomnia,1631348048,"When you say major side effects, that's include Insomnia?"
2043,hcevedd,,,insomnia,1631347617,"Simple answer is yes, Lexapro being a serotonin reuptake inhibitor can cause sleep issues or insomnia as it is actively affecting the chemicals in your brain. 

When it comes to these medications it's going to take some trial and error to find the correct one. 

Lexapro was awful for me and I experienced major side effects, after a couple of other medications I eventually landed on Paxil and that has helped me tremendously."
2044,hcevbiv,,,insomnia,1631347543,"Let me know if you ever need anything. I think that with treatment, you'll able to stop having this problem. I know it must be terrifying

You seem like a cool person btw 💕💛🧡"
2045,hcev0sc,,,insomnia,1631347281,Also helps with anxiety so i like it more than an antihistamine so ill talk to my doctor about that then too
2046,hceucg4,,,insomnia,1631346660,"Dude/girl , the syrup version would not be better or worse than the pills , a chemical is a chemical , hydroxyzine / atarax is an antihistamine, like benedryl , it’s just that , they will give it to you , regardless if they don’t want a specific version , they will be like what? Because that makes no sense , you can take pills and crush them into powder and make a syrup if that will make you happy , but that is an allergy pill used for other reasons too , of course it’s worth asking because they would have no reason to be hesitant to give it to you , it’s not a controlled substance in the traditional sense , if it helps , ask and take it"
2047,hceqvw6,,,insomnia,1631343594,"Yeah insomnia makes you really sensitive especially when u suffer long term from it, like almost anything can keep you from sleeping, makes enjoying things hard cz u relate it to not getting sleep afterwards, idk how many nights i couldnt sleep from just good things"
2048,hceq87u,,,insomnia,1631343032,"Oh if its takes 3hrs thats kinda long, i used melatonin aswel long ago but not much mg, it wasnt really working in that time so i stopped taking it"
2049,hcepvw1,,,insomnia,1631342749,Thats true. When I am too excited about something.. its hard to fall asleep. Then next morning all the excitement is gone and i feel like shit.
2050,hcepdnn,,,insomnia,1631342328,"Oh yes thats so true! cz since i have insomnia even positive things messing up my sleep, thats why its so hard for me too get this fixed"
2051,hceok1f,,,insomnia,1631341662,"Hey bro ik ur feeling hopeless and tired and very fucken angry but u gotta keep ur head up, you get 2-3 hours of sleep boom get up start ur day push through drink some energy drinks or something but u gotta keep moving foward, as long as u get some type of micro sleep ur gonna be ok and if u lie awake at night relax ik its easier said than done but watch something or go for a walk the point is get distracted, and eventually u’ll get better but u cant give up"
2052,hceno0b,,,insomnia,1631340970,"Damn ik what u mean i see posts of people all the time talking about how they get barely enough sleep and are always tired, but then i see my family and friends and they dont seem to be bothered by sleep, and do it like its nothing

Before i followed this reddit i was so scared and felt alone bc no one else suffered from not being able to sleep, i felt crazy, and thought i was for sure dead but honestly eventually u do sleep and this reddit has made me feel less alone"
2053,hcencp8,,,insomnia,1631340720,"Hey man keep ur head up dont give up ik theres times where u feel like nothing is changing and its getting worse, but there is always an end to everything u got this relax and dont give up

At the end of the day ur getting some sleep and thats worth alot"
2054,hcen3ew,,,insomnia,1631340506,"I know the feeling. I always feel alone too even if I know I am not the only one suffering from it. My family has no problems with sleeping. I especially feel alone when people try to make fun of this condition and it’s not funny at all. 

When my cousin suffered from insomnia too, I didn’t feel alone at all. Then he got diagnosed with diabetes, now he sleeps like a baby.
 I don’t know why I can’t sleep. That’s why I’ll go to a sleep clinic. 

Stay strong"
2055,hceixuy,,,insomnia,1631337353,"Remember that not everyone feels the same sleeping 8 hours. Often, we focus on how little sleep we are getting. So, I need to be up at 7? I start counting down as soon as I decide it’s time to try and sleep. Hence the time we think we have to rest, makes sleep difficult, or even impossible."
2056,hceil9y,,,insomnia,1631337100,No need. We are all dealing with this.
2057,hceikeu,,,insomnia,1631337083,Don’t feel that way. We all see and hear you.
2058,hceifuy,,,insomnia,1631336992,It’s a vicious cycle. Insomnia more preys on your subconscious conflicts. It can be anything. Whatever issue is on your mind. Doesn’t even have to be negative. Anything that has messed with your sleep clock. Or your daily routine. Perhaps your life mindset in general.
2059,hcehoh6,,,insomnia,1631336464,"Okay for the record I had Insomnia but fixed it (it was all psychologically induced)  I've often seen the ""get out of bed"" listed in good sleep habits, but I'll be honest with you I've found better success staying in bed

I experimented with getting up and reading a book or something not too active or interesting, but the cycle of not going to bed just kept repeating 

Instead I stayed in bed and just listened to music. Hated having to get up and out of bed then try to go to sleep every 40 mins

I personally say experiment and do what you find works best for your body"
2060,hceedzo,,,insomnia,1631334284,"&gt;alprazolam 

I took xanax 0.5mg once and it turned me into a zombie for 3 days, felt like I had brain damage couldn't recognize some colors etc. Slept fantastic though."

2064,hce63o0,,,insomnia,1631329370,have you tried  Melatonin ?
2065,hce5nv9,,,insomnia,1631329126,"I take 100 mg of Gabapentin most nights ,,; seems to take about 3 hours to kick in. And 30 mg of Melatonin works faster."

2084,hcddjv1,,,insomnia,1631314806,"Definitely feels alone in this battle sometimes. 

I recently went home and talked to my best friend who told me he sleeps 2am-3am every single day and wakes up 8am almost daily. he doesn’t have insomnia but only sleeps 5-6hrs and havent slept 7-9hrs for years.  My sister and mom wakes up every single night to pee so they have disrupted sleep and have not heard them complain in real life. 

l realized that I whine so much about not getting 7-9hrs every day. My issue is that I wake up 2-3x a night. Most of the time, I am out in seconds after I woke up but in some cases, it would take me 20-45mins to sleep. I do get enough sleep still and wakes up refreshed in the morning."

2099,hcd1d0p,,,insomnia,1631309130,"In my experience, psychiatrists can go either way. Some will do z drugs faster, but some, like mine, will put you on all sorts of non controlled drugs thinking it's a better alternative to take 4 different medications before bed instead of 1 controlled med. I was trying to find a new psychiatrist for myself, because really only mental health professionals can diagnose primary insomnia. Sleep studies only show apnea or RLS or narcolepsy."
2100,hcd0otm,,,insomnia,1631308833,"Yes. It might also depend on your age. Doctors probably don't like prescribing z-drugs if you're a teenager or young. And, frankly, a teenager might simply grow out of it normally.

But, yes, once you've tried something like trazadone, they'll probably up the dose of it, then maybe go on to a z-drug if that doesn't work. That might take a few months of going back to the doctor until you get a z-drug.

A psychiatrist might prescribe it faster, or may simply prefer to use expensive therapy that doesn't work.  :("
2101,hcczjxh,,,insomnia,1631308334,"Benzos have a short half life in your system. After a few hours, their effectiveness is gone. You may want to look into something for ""maintenance insomnia."" Gabapentin is a good one, as it helps regulate your sleep cycles. Or they have actual sleep medications that last longer. There's a controlled release Ambien that stays in your system longer, rather than quick release Ambien that just puts you to sleep. Look up sleep medications for maintenance insomnia, and talk to your doctor."
2102,hccz3f9,,,insomnia,1631308131,"So that sounds like generalized anxiety, maybe. Anxiety doesn't always mean you panic about everything. It means that maybe you worry a lot. Maybe you have a lot of ""what if"" scenarios that lead to more ""what if"" questions. It's kind of like a spiral for me. I have anxiety, but I'm not stressed out. I think, at night, about whether I'll sleep enough before the baby gets up. If I don't, can I take care of him right? Can I be the mom he needs? What am I going to feed him? Will he eat it? Will I have the energy to make him food? 

It's a spiral of worry and thoughts. And worrying about sleeping, on your happy days, also affects your sleep. Mindfulness meditation can help. Focus hard on clearing your mind of thoughts, of worry about your sleep. Focus on deep breathing, 4 seconds in, 4 seconds out. Meditation stopped working for me, and that's why I'm on benzos now. It quiets my mind."

2104,hccyeko,,,insomnia,1631307824,"Yeah i take sometimes Oxazepam that the doctor gave me, but it dont keep me asleep. Besides that i dont take anything else really. But i have therapy but its not helping so far, do u take anything that helps u sleep?"
2105,hccxzh0,,,insomnia,1631307638,"well I'm never really stressed. I don't feel stress! I don't have any of the physical symptoms of stress... I might get worried at times but it's just my mind thinking things...

 I guess I did have depression... I'm not sure cause I was never diagnosed but for 1 year of my life I felt trapped desperate and I literally felt like I was locked somewhere...

 I almost killed myself I didn't try but I was thinking about it... I still don't know cause I was a kid I was only 11! I'm 15 now... 

The point is that I can't sleep in my happy or normal days either! It's not just the over thinking that's keeping me it's the lack of sleepiness... If you know what I mean"

2107,hccxbso,,,insomnia,1631307353,"The real question is, do you have anxiety? Or depression? Both of those things can greatly affect your sleep or ability to sleep."
2108,hccwxbi,,,insomnia,1631307176,I know. Do you take anything for your sleep trouble? Have you seen a doctor?

2110,hccva9u,,,insomnia,1631306476,Sounds like restless leg syndrome. You may need to see a sleep doctor for a sleep study. They hook you up all over to monitor if your legs are kicking around at night. It can interrupt your sleep cycles and make sleeping less restful.
2111,hccv087,,,insomnia,1631306357,It definitely is a lonely feeling.. I use to sleep great two weeks ago and now here I am .. feeling like my world got flipped upside down
2112,hccuy7l,,,insomnia,1631306333,"Like the other person said, you have to keep a similar sleep schedule on your days off. Get black out curtains for your room. Your circadian rhythm needs a chance to catch up, because it's going against the natural order of things. I worked a 12 hour overnight at the hospital for a while, get home at 7am, and only sleep until noon. Then nap quick before I start again at 7 the next night. And coffee."
2113,hccuro5,,,insomnia,1631306255,Wow yeah that would of been super scary!!! I’m sorry you had to go through that. Do you think your anxiety is causing your insomnia? Have you tried melatonin or anything?
2114,hccuh5c,,,insomnia,1631306130,"It's called maintenance insomnia. People like me have onset insomnia, can't fall asleep. If this has been going on a while, you might see a doc about it. There are medications that help you stay asleep, besides controlled stuff like Ambien and Lindsay. Gabapentin is a med they gave me when I was having trouble STAYING asleep. It did help for a while. The dosages taken for gabapentin can vary greatly, from 100 mg to 3600 mg, but don't worry about that, it's normal."
2115,hccu8xy,,,insomnia,1631306033,"This is a tough one. The only thing I know that helps is you must stay on the same sleep schedule 7-days a week, even on your days off. Most third shifters do try to switch over to regular hours on their days off, some have some success but a lot don't. I think the sleep schedule just can't change once your on it."
2116,hcctogb,,,insomnia,1631305791,"You're most definitely not alone. I'm the only one I know who has it. My husband can sleep upside down hanging by his feet in a tree and wake up refreshed. It sucks, but there's a lot of people that have trouble."
2117,hcctgi7,,,insomnia,1631305699,"Yes, anxiety is definitely going on. My insomnia started suddenly the day my son was born, 28 years ago. In the hospital a few hours after he was born and sleeping next to my bed in his little cart, I was sleeping and a plain clothed nurse came and took him from there just as I was barely waking…..and she disappeared with him. I panicked and hit the button and had the hospital track him down, and he was in the assessment area and he was fine, but she didn’t look like a nurse and scared the hell out of me. I didn’t sleep for five days straight."
2118,hcctg44,,,insomnia,1631305694,if you slept deeply for most of your life then you screw it with stress for few days then it does not get the same ever again cause i did same thing and i got screwed
2119,hcctebx,,,insomnia,1631305672,"Not terribly hard, depending on the doctor, but they will try other things first, probably, because z drugs are controlled. Like drugs that make you sleepy. Trazodone or maybe clonidine."
2120,hccssfr,,,insomnia,1631305414,"If you have daytime sleepiness, you may want a doctor to take a look at you. Daytime sleepiness could be an effect of something else. Do you have more problems FALLING asleep, or STAYING asleep?"
2121,hccse57,,,insomnia,1631305243,"Should be quick. Benzodiazepines like Xanax are meant for acute panic attacks, so onset is like 20-30 minutes. I think lorazepam is similar in that way. I take mine when I'm already in bed. If I'm up and moving around when I take it, I can feel the ""loosey goosey"" effects. But in bed, when I'm ready for sleep, I don't really feel it. I just get drowsy and then sleep."

I am not going to lie. I have trouble falling asleep after midnight which ends up with me lying in the bed. Aside from the body and brain needing it, I kind of think sleep is useless for a human being. It would be so much better if the person can just stay awake 24/7."

2139,hccft9h,,,insomnia,1631299861,"I would call it insomnia if you're struggling with sleep for a long period of time so idk how long u sleeping bad,  like if its only a few days or week than its not that hard to fix I think. If u think its ""hunger"" than try to eat more in the evening maybe so u dont wake up hungry(:  I also wake up many times at night n always before the alarm n often I cant fall sleep, its terrible ngl.  and I have tried melatonin in the past wasn't working for me either to stay asleep.  Also dont focus too much on how many hours u need cz that's kinda my problem tbh I keep thinking I need 7/8 hrs too to function and too feel normal but you cant really control sleep anw, so this thinking can ruin ur sleep more. and my sleep is this week so messedup also that idk what to do about it myself at this point..  nothing seems to work for me so far. but there are things u can try atleast like meditation, scents oils, mindfulness, natural medication things like that,  like im hard to fix ig so this all isn't the cure for me, but maybe its for you(:"
2140,hccdts5,,,insomnia,1631299018,"There's ways (especially now days) that you can minimize the amount of blue light from technology. There's a ""nightlight"" function on PCs and phones. So there is a way to use that stuff without exposing yourself to blue light. 

I actually have a timer on my PC to turn the nightlight function on at a certain time of the day."
2141,hccbkma,,,insomnia,1631298057,"iirc, it was just at night. It was many years ago, before I switched to zopiclone, so I don't remember how many I took (they were 1mg pills). Probably took 2 each night, before bed. They weren't bad, but zopiclone is much more effective for sleep, at least for myself. I still have a few lorazepam pills left (which is how I know what the dose was), but I'm sure they're long expired so I should just throw them out."
2142,hcc9jef,,,insomnia,1631297180,"I’d recommend seeing a doctor if it lasts more than a few weeks, especially if it’s affecting your daily life and performance. In the meantime, though, remember to practice good sleep hygiene. Go to bed at the same time every night (even on weekends!) and wake up at the same time every morning. Don’t use your bed for anything other than sleep — don’t do homework or watch TV in it! It’ll make your brain associate your bed with wakefulness. And, of course, no electronics before bed. You can also look into taking melatonin supplements if you haven’t already, or even meditation. It may sound silly, but it can really help calm you down before bed (even if you already feel calm!) Best of luck to you, I hope you get good rest soon."
2143,hcc8o2b,,,insomnia,1631296808,"I get the fear of FFI too, but it’s extremely unlikely that you have it, especially if you don’t know anyone in your family that does. Try resting as much as you can. I’m sure that you’ve gotten at least some microsleep or something. Like the other commenter said, try and find a doctor as soon as possible to help you with your insomnia."
2144,hcc7zqd,,,insomnia,1631296516,"Meditation, perhaps?"
2145,hcc7uid,,,insomnia,1631296454,"If you’ve been laying there for awhile and can’t sleep, then get up and do something relaxing for a bit. Don’t do work, don’t do anything that will get you going — reread a book that’s slow-paced, or maybe even something boring like an old textbook. Maybe you can meditate. Then, after it’s been awhile and you feel tired or relaxed, get back into bed and try to sleep again. You should repeat this and eventually you’ll fall asleep, even if you don’t improve right away and it takes several nights for this to work. They key is to make your body associate your bed with sleep, and not anxiety, ruminating, or even just being awake. That being said, I don’t recommend “starting the day” when you get up. Lying down with your eyes closed is still rest, and it will help you infinitely more than pushing your sleep-deprived body to the limit."
2146,hcc6la0,,,insomnia,1631295923,"i had this problem too. aside from melatonin, strict sleep hygiene and earplugs has helped me a lot. so has therapy to reduce overall stress and anxiety, and relaxing before bed."
2147,hcc16k5,,,insomnia,1631293654,Yes i think they are pretty similar:) also did you take them every night or just casually? Thank you for your answer 💗
2148,hcc0c7s,,,insomnia,1631293313,"Definitely see a doctor. There are a lot of options available for someone with new insomnia. It could be just STARTING school caused a sleep problem, even if you have no identifiable stressors. Hope you get some rest soon."
2149,hcc09d7,,,insomnia,1631293281,"Unfortunately, benzos or z-drugs (such as ambien) are probably your best bet. If you don't want to take them for whatever reason, antihistamines (like Benadryl) or anti-depressants (like trazadone) are about your only option.

You can try some placebos, like herbal stuff. Or melatonin. For some people, it's enough. For serious insomniacs, you have to use something that really works. Your choices are antihistamines, psych drugs (there are lots of options), z-drugs (they work best), or benzos (useful if it's treating anxiety)."
2150,hcbzney,,,insomnia,1631293031,"I used lorazepam for a short time (not sure if it's the same thing), and yes, it works. I eventually settled on zopiclone, instead. Better for sleep, and less addictive. Benzos are better if your sleep in related to anxiety. But, don't ever stop benzos cold-turkey if you've been taking them for awhile; that can be dangerous."

2152,hcbxu1i,,,insomnia,1631292308,Good luck on your journey! Seeking help from a doc is a good step in trying to fix your sleep. I wish you the best!
2153,hcbxmxj,,,insomnia,1631292229,They put in a sleep referral for me.. thanks friend
2154,hcbxmmv,,,insomnia,1631292226,"Thanks for your kind words. Unfortunately, I have been on Xanax long term. Years. But as a military wife, I keep having this doctor to doctor revolving door. I leave, or they leave, and I have to explain it all over again and deal with the looks I get when explaining this ""highly addictive"" and ""highly controlled"" medication is all that works, and I look like an addict.

My last PCP was cool with it when she couldn't think of any alternatives I haven't tried. Then she left the practice and I got stuck with this horrible new woman who treated me like an addict, but reluctantly agreed after I repeatedly reminded her that trazodone and melatonin do not help. When I was due for a refill, she said she'd fill it, then dodged my calls for a week when I asked if she'd filled it yet. That was a week of Benadryl and melatonin, morning hangovers with interrupted sleep all night.

So yesterday I switched to a new primary that wasn't vindictive. And she was so understanding, gave me Belsomra samples (which I will try again tonight, but last night wasn't great with my first trial run). She told me ""we won't let you run out of Xanax if that's what you need."" I could've cried. I'm responsible. I just want to be the mom my baby deserves. By now I'm physically dependent, but I don't abuse.

I worked in pain management clinics for years. I saw addicts, and I saw people in legitimate need. Finally, I got a doctor who understands, and hopefully I can see her for a long time to come. We're not leaving this duty station for a while.

Sometimes I wake up early when the half-life wears off, and can't go back to sleep. But it's not often anymore. It's mainly onset insomnia. And Xanax quiets my mind, and I drift off peacefully."
2155,hcbwyii,,,insomnia,1631291958,"Dang, sorry that happened :/

Try talking to a doctor. They may be able to help."
2156,hcbwqsj,,,insomnia,1631291873,"Unfortunately no. Last fight was probably one of the worst nights I had so far. I went to bed at 11am woke up at 1230, couldn’t fall back to sleep so I took half a melatonin 1.5mg and I put my snoreRX sleep guard together. I tried it but it was really hard to sleep with it in, made my mouth sore so I ended up taking it out. I took the other half of the melatonin and that seems like it got me to sleep from 4-630… then kinda just laid in bed half asleep until 930…. Needless to say my sleep was garbage :( 

I appreciate you for following up with me tho… means a lot"
2157,hcbwpgy,,,insomnia,1631291858,"If I only waken up two or three times I feel fine but when I get bouts, (2 to 3 of weeks) of real restlessness like I described above it can be grim. The doc says that's just the way I am, he doesn't think it's your 'A typical anxiety' where you keep thinking about things and that keeps you wide awake. He says my condition is rarer and there is not much you do about it apart from the usual sleep hygiene. I train a lot and this can make it worse, especially anaerobic exercise later on in the day. I now do all my workouts in the morning, have one cup of  non de-cafe coffee first thing and after that de-cafe and even then coffee intake stops at 11am. No sugary food after 2pm, I eat early like 4 or 5 pm, no fluid after 6pm, black out blinds, no computer or phone after 9pm. I don't know what else to do, I'm certainly not going down the road of medication, funny thing is when you here people that are similarly afflicted you don't feel so bad, well you still do at 5am."
2158,hcbvz87,,,insomnia,1631291570,Any success?
2159,hcbuuob,,,insomnia,1631291122,Give me a hug
2160,hcbul5s,,,insomnia,1631291019,"&gt; I've tried everything over the years. Sleep doctors. Psychiatrists. Therapy. A sleep study to rule out apnea. Ambien, lunesta, various generalized anxiety medications, melatonin, Benadryl, trazodone, clonidine, antidepressants, muscle relaxers, and more.

Do we have the same doctor lol? I’ve been prescribed the same meds over the years and some people look at me like I’m crazy for taking stuff like clonidine to sleep. But even that doesn’t even work! 😩

Glad to hear you’ve had success with Xanax tho! My guess as to why is Xanax is a benzo that’s relatively powerful with a short half life (speaking comparatively to other benzos at least), so it can be a good knock out punch from the get-go, compared with others that have a longer half life and take longer to metabolize. It’s good to hear that it keeps you asleep for a while - my personal experience with Xanax is that it’s great while it lasts but I wake up pretty quickly once it reaches its half life in my body.

And look, as someone who is in benzo recovery, yeah, it’s true taking benzos for long periods of time isn’t ideal. They’re both hard to get off of and you have to taper off of them realllllyyy slowly in order to stop them safely. But as a fellow woman who deals with insomnia, honestly, if taking Xanax to help you sleep helps you get the rest you need to be the wife, mom and person you need to be during the day, cut yourself some slack. No ones perfect, and I can’t imagine how stressful it must be to have a little kid and a husband who’s deployed - just wanna say thanks to him for his service and thanks to you too for being a good partner &amp; support system to him! That’s also a big part of service imho. I don’t have even close to that much responsibility and insomnia is still super tough, so I really admire how strong you’re being under those circumstances.

Anyway, long term, Xanax isn’t the best option, but if it’s what you need for now, I say just keep taking it (safely!) and be mindful of times you might have the emotional bandwidth to switch to a non-benzo. Hang in there!! 💛"
2161,hcbudkk,,,insomnia,1631290935,"Been to years of therapy. I'm in a great spot, mentally. It's just anxiety. A barrage of thoughts. Xanax helps because it shuts up my brain, it makes me sleepy, and is effectively gone from my body in a few hours, meaning the hangover I get from normal sleep drugs is completely non existent. I just found a doctor who will keep up the Xanax without looking at me like a drug seeker. She understands I'm not abusing it, that I've tried everything. I have anxiety because of years of trauma and mental instability. I've been at this insomnia game for 20 years now. 

I'm sure my sleep cycle is physically dependent on Xanax by now. But 1 tablet, at night, and I'm relaxed and asleep."
2162,hcbu7wp,,,insomnia,1631290873,"I know the experts say don’t stay in bed if you can’t sleep. But I am very physically active, so when I can’t sleep I stay prone so that my body can rest. Also I don’t want to have to turn on lights, or look at a TV glow that will make me less able to sleep. Listening to an audiobook or a podcast or music in the dark works much better for me."

2166,hcbt7nj,,,insomnia,1631290471,"The usual reason is because they don't address the true underlying cause for the insomnia, only the symptom -- sleep, or lack thereof.

Your key to improving this likely will be identifying the basis, and addressing that effectively.  Beware the possibility it may not be medical at all -- that's actually most common.  Typically some nonmed combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.

To treat that, the standard of care is use of a CBT sleep training system.  Might ask your doc if that'd be appropriate for you."

2168,hcbsuxu,,,insomnia,1631290326,"Can't speak to your specifics, but the usual types are primary vs secondary, acute vs chronic.  Many other sub-categories from there.

In your case it would appear you're awakening to some degree upon completion of a sleep cycle.  Some level of arousal is completely normal.  The good news is you're able to fall back asleep.

Key for you is how you feel and perform during waking hours, unclear from your post.  

Be sure to talk to your doc about any possible medical causes, and if nothing identifiable, then use of a CBT sleep training system might be a big help."

2171,hcboc0k,,,insomnia,1631288490,"Acceptance and time really. 

But I worked really hard on those three things; Stress, Exercise, and being more Social. Sounds simple, but I tried a lot. Pills, therapy, searching for answers but for me it was getting away from all of that and getting back to my life as usual that eventually seemed to help. It wasn’t an over night fix either, but it slowly started getting better. 2hrs of sleep a night, to 4 hours for a while, and then eventually 6-8.

The pills, the therapy, the fear of being a insomniac terrified me and I think that it all continued to fuel that cycle of anxiety. I had to break that cycle to get better.

I always felt like my insomnia was exacerbated tenfold by the anxiety I developed around sleeping. I was so desperate to sleep that I would stress about it like crazy which ultimately made things worse but I couldn’t control it. Insomnia seriously ruled my life. 

But however great seroquel has been for me, I think why I sleep so well these days is because I’m also treating my underlying depression. Most doctors will tell you that insomnia isn’t a primary condition, it’s secondary, so something is causing it. In my case depression. So finding a suitable antidepressant is probably what allowed me time effectively lower my dose of seroquel overtime. If you’re really getting desperate with your insomnia, I’d definitely talk to your doctor about it."

&amp;#x200B;

In short, your negative thoughts are distorted. You're having these automatic negative thoughts, and your thoughts effects your mood and emotions, which causes you to be depressed. You have to recognize that, and train your brain to not do that anymore. There's exercises and stuff that you can do to help. Just read the book and learn about CBT. There's also a book called say good night to insomnia. It's also helpful. What do you have to lose? Waste some time reading a book or two? But what do you have to gain? Feel happy and normal again? Sounds like it's worth it to me. Good luck :) you can do it!"

2206,hcatsml,,,insomnia,1631274261,"I’ve actually had a great experience with seroquel and I tried literally everything before it to get my insomnia under control. I started medication for insomnia at 20 and just had a natural tolerance to downers it seemed. I would take double the dose of Ambien approved for a women and not sleep for a second and with benzos I needed such huge doses of that it didn’t make sense. Everything else had zero effect on me whatsoever and I was so desperate. The first thing that actually helped me sleep was seroquel and when I began it at around age 24-25, I was on 300mg a night which is a lot! I’m now 29 and only need 25mg, so oddly enough my tolerance went down over several years, as if my body adjusted to sleeping well and not having insomnia. I don’t stress about sleep anymore, even when I travel or do something that’s outside of my comfort zone and back in the day, that would have been a guarantee for zero sleep. 

If you have severe insomnia, I can’t recommend it enough but everyone is different. Seroquel is no joke, it’s strong but if you stay at the lowest effective dose for you, I think the side effects are very minimal. I experience zero noticeable side effects on my dose but 300mg did make me sleepy during the day and hungry at night. Good luck with whatever you decide :)"

But I highly advice against becoming homeless for perspective, please reconsider.  Maybe you get perspective, but you could also just compound new problems on your old ones.  

I’m sorry if I sound rude, but it was a little annoying you assumed I just needed perspective to get over it.  That fucking blows tbh.  I know, how could you know, it’s not fair to reply like this.  But it’s a really big punch in the gut.  It’s kind of more reason to truly not care, because a lot of people do it, and I have to wonder if they are the ones who need perspective as the literal scars from deployment are up the side of my neck.

Yeah I do unfortunately also have acid reflux issues, which I think are common for people with anxiety, well it's kind of like a chicken/egg thing as to whether the reflux or anxiety came first, but on the r/gerd subreddit theres tonnns of posts talking about anxiety.  I guess like you're saying, there's pretty much countless reasons for why sleep issues can occur, it does make it harder to narrow down the cause &amp; figure out a treatment.

Trazadone had the same effect.

There are only three meds that actually put me to sleep:  xanax, lunesta &amp; ambien.  Ambien gives me hives though, so I can't take it for more than a day or two.

I take a very low dose of it once nightly at the moment. I find that it's better than other over the counter methods that can be dangerous if taken everyday on the reg.

2282,hc8v9yt,,,insomnia,1631231091,"Wondering if you're up and active during this entire time or do you lie in bed for any part at all.  That's because so much of insomnia is sleep state misperception, meaning we are actually asleep but don't realize it.

If that's the case with you, getting a handle on your actual sleep will likely be part of your solution.

As for the substances, the usual reason they don't work is because they're not treating the true underlying cause for the insomnia.  That's why it's a good idea to get a checkup to ensure no med conditions.  

If none the usual standard of care is use of a CBT sleep training system."

More doesn’t actually help and can possibly make it worse 0.3mg-2 mg is best. I tried some CBD oil with melatonin in it and it seemed helpful although definitely not perfect.

What I have been doing now that I wake up everyday around 3 to 4am is to stay in bed and use the Seals relaxation techinque, breath in for 4 seconds, hold it for 7 and release for 8s, everytime I do that I think: is not going to work, this is not going to work, this is not working!..but it works! if you do it over and over and over again. 

It is taking me 1h tough, is not magical...Also I am not constant, begin the breathing and my mind deviates to other thing and then I go back and focus and try again for some minutes. But I believe if you try, at least try for 30min you will go back to sleep sooner than that that because you have to concentrate in holding your breath and counting."

I broke my wrist last year and when I was on pain meds for that, I still couldn't sleep.  So I just deal with it my own way. A lot of friends just don't get it.

Neuroscience would like to disagree with you heavily. Sleep deprivation causes permanent, and irreversible brain damage and structural and functional abnormalities; a good highlight of this is the increase of toxic amyloid-beta protein plaques and tau protein tangles, these 2 neurotoxic proteins are the primary mechanism of how sleep deprivation causes Alzheimer's/Dementia. 

It's also worth noting that sleep helps clear and manage these toxic proteins to a certain degree. But it's also worth noting that these 2 toxic proteins can accumulate enough, to impair the brains ability to fall asleep, and all faucets of sleep architecture. These changes can be very permanent, if we could simply reverse them, Alzheimer's would be cured. 

Also insomnia disrupts your circadian rhythm which further exacerbates itself. Insomnia and drug use can cause a plethora of health conditions that can disrupt sleep architecture even further. 

There's a lot more to it. But the idea that insomnia is just easily treated by vitamin deficiencies is a little laughable and just pseudoscience and homeopathic alternatives in the way you're using it."

2361,hc7pea7,,,insomnia,1631213295,"Aside from using meds which didn't work all that great:

1. Had some surgeries to solve chronic pain that was causing me extensive anxiety

2. Became rich so I no longer need to work which has totally changed the stress dynamic at my place of employment (ok this didn't just happen overnight)"

Another option is to employ some ACTi and just lie in bed to rest your body, not to fall asleep.  This can paradoxically help you sleep when you take the pressure off yourself to try to sleep."
2366,hc7oybm,,,insomnia,1631213112,"How did you treat your anxiety disorder,please?"
2367,hc7ofqw,,,insomnia,1631212899,"I struggled with insomnia for about 5 years. I could never figure it out… until I realized and was later diagnosed with sleep apnea. I am able to sleep now. I cried the first morning after I used a mouthguard (look up Zyppah or SnoreRX) to help treat it. I hadn’t hit REM in years. 

Dr. Barry Krakow studied middle of the night insomniacs, and discovered 90% of participants had sleep apnea. [https://youtu.be/izgtCxsLVd0](https://youtu.be/izgtCxsLVd0)

Get a sleep study if you have insomnia. It could be the answer. Even if you don’t have sleep apnea, it’s better to 1st rule out the possibility, because it’s treatable. Sleep apnea does not just affect older and overweight people. Amy Pohler has sleep apnea. It's incredibly common."
2368,hc7n85c,,,insomnia,1631212410,"Ahhh...yes, the sleep journal and sleep hygiene. Did nothing for me either. The specialist was rather indignant that it wasn’t helping and at times insinuated that I wasn’t trying hard enough or doing things correctly. 
I’ve actually been on multiple medications for several years. As much as I hate being on them and I’ve scaled back from my initial doses, it is slightly better than not sleeping at all. I had reached the point where I felt like I was going crazy. Having said that, with or without meds, it was/is extreme fatigue and unable to think straight/in a mental fog. Every aspect of my life-work, relationships, school, has been affected. 
Have you seen a therapist to explore the root of your anxiety and see if that is an underlying cause? I feel like in trying to read up on different things over the years, there’s so many random reasons for insomnia such as acid reflux, some people can produce too much histamine(who knew?), etc and since most drs look at common causes they don’t think outside the box. I agree as well that it feels isolating when you think you’re the only one living with chronic insomnia. 
That’s wonderful that you like Boston so much. I actually grew up here so I feel pretty lucky. I spent 10 years in San Diego and I will say the weather was amazing there. But to your point yesterday, I never got to ‘truly’ experience everything I wanted to there because I would sleep until 1/2 in the afternoon most days. Then I  be so upset and it would be vicious cycle. *sigh* lol"
2369,hc7mq4j,,,insomnia,1631212206,Try a Zyppah or a SnoreRx. Mandibular advancement devices help more than a regular mouthguard. I also use a nasal dilator at the same time to open my nasal passages. Both really help together.
2370,hc7m01y,,,insomnia,1631211914,"For someone with insomnia, it’s impossible to make yourself go to bed earlier.  What’s the point, you just lay there.    I’m also a natural night owl.  

So on a day off, I made myself stay up overnight and all day.  Went to bed at 7 pm the next day and slept nine hours straight through with the help of my nightly trazodone.   If I napped even an hour in the day,  couldn’t sleep that night. 

I had to cycle this for four days in a row.   Now I am sleeping better overnight.  I give myself 30 - 60 minute allotment to fall asleep depending on how I feel.   Then I only sleep for 8 hours and force myself to get up.   Having a longer day in daylight seems to help me sleep better overnight.   

It helps me to fall asleep by looking up a topic on the internet that interests me.  Nothing too serious or sad.   Or I think about a memory with my grandparents or think about how I would change my life if I won a big lottery.   Then I think about it when I lie down in bed.  

Good quote:  
If you’re living in the past, you’re depressed. 
If you’re living in the future, you have anxiety. 
If you are living in the present, you are at peace. 

I was 50 before I could implement this quote.  By then I’d had many ups and downs in life and finally realized the shit of life didn’t kill me and never will.   


I was just reading that being in outdoor sunlight 15 minutes a day helps to improve sleep.  

And read about how adenosine works in our bodies:   It is a catabolism product of burning ATP.    Adenosine slowly builds up in our blood and is highest at night to help us sleep.  It binds to brain cells that tell our brain we’re tired.   To help adenosine work, stop drinking caffeine by 2 pm and only have 2-3 caffeinated drinks earlier than this.   Webmd.com suggested taking tumeric supplement to increase adenosine, but only up to 3g daily for up to three months.  Larger dose may cause nausea, diarrhea, or dizziness.     I also read that exercise increases ATP consumption for energy which results in increased adenosine as an end product; so we may sleep better if we exercise during daytime, but don’t exercise in the four hours before sleep - for us insomniacs, I personally would extend that time. 

I am considering listening to audiobooks with the lights out in my recliner chair for an hour before bed and see if cutting out light helps me to get drowsy.  

This drives me nuts -  when I get little sleep, the next evening I rarely feel drowsy.  I only get a headache. Why can’t I feel drowsy or sleepy like most people do even with a great sleep deficit!   Is this true for any of you also?"

You can try ramping up general  stress management -- including good physical exercise to really tire yourself out during the day -- and a nice hour or so before bedtime to just unwind and relax screen free.

Keeping a consistent wake time without sleeping in is also important to regulate your body clock.

If you need more help, talk to your doctor."
2388,hc72mrm,,,insomnia,1631203894,"Stress about sleep is another potent cause to consider.  You can try ramping up stress management methods.  Good physical exercise is one, but also addressing the persistent negative stressful thought is maybe more important.  You might consider counseling for that.

If you need more help, you can also talk to your doc to ensure any medical issues are beig treated."
2389,hc724hp,,,insomnia,1631203684,"Couple of issues here, may or may not be correlated.

One is the back/shoulder pain.  That could be from sleep position.  What you're doing by changing positions is one good strategy.  You can sort of prop yourself into preferred positions using a bunched up blanket or rolled up towel for support.  See a physical therapist for more ideas.

The second is sleep, and that may not be necessarily be connected to the back/shoulder issue.  You can start addressing that with some basic sleep hygiene ideas to see if that helps.  If you have no other unaddressed med issues, use of a full CBT sleep training system will give you a substance free comprehensive solution."

Anyway the case that you sleep better after binge-eating doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with your diet, though that is still worth exploring.

2410,hc6lq1u,,,insomnia,1631196648,"Carbohydrates at dinner helps tryptophan pass the blood-brain barrier, which increases sleep pressure. Calories in excess will yield that turkey-dinner effect (though digestion can worsen sleep quality) while restriction usually comes with insomnia symptoms. Increasing total protein intake helps mitigate that effect and improves sleep in those restricting calories. It's possible your maintenance-level is bordering on restriction or that you would benefit from consuming more protein particularly earlier in the day and a higher ratio of carbohydrates at dinner, so that could be worth experimenting with. 

The other case: people often binge-eat when stressed. Your cortisol levels are lower after binge-eating. Stress could have been worsening your sleep. Therefore, find other ways to manage your stress.

Being at a healthier weight improves sleep in general so worth sticking with"

I felt like I was too needy and demanding before, I got the “so and so’s wife doesn’t go to bed at the same time as him and it’s fine” to me, if both parties want the relationship to be a partnership, compromising on things like bed times (unless it’s work related) is perfectly fine.

For example I have read 4 books about b12 deficiency all of which say the standard range of 200 to 900 is wrong. They all say the lower end should be at least 450. B12 deficiency can cause among many other things insomnia. 

That's just one of many examples. It's not easy but just because you got basic bloodwork, which doesn't even test that, doesn't mean much. I think some of you just want to feel sorry for yourselves."

2423,hc6f1lv,,,insomnia,1631193442,"Few things. I usually have headphones in my ears to listen to podcasts and white noise at the same time. I use my Apple EarPods for it, because wireless headphones that are reasonably comfortable to sleep with always have battery lives under 8 hours. I also have the Bose SleepBuds, which are wireless, and super comfortable, with awesome battery life because you’re technically listening to sounds that are downloaded directly to the buds themselves, with the caveat that you can’t use any other types of audio besides the ones offered by the app. Sometimes I really just need speech to distract me from trying to fall asleep.

If I could find a pair of buds that are 75% as comfortable as the SleepBuds, last as long battery-wise, and have the ability to let you play other types of media, I’d be pumped.

Also, this might be possible with Android, but I’d love the ability to set the volume on different apps. There are tons of podcasts/YT series that are either too loud, or too quiet to use in conjunction with the white noise app. If I could set the volumes independently, I’d would be awesome."

It makes me want to argue that I can’t solve insomnia from compounding military trauma with some vitamins and a can do attitude.  Makes me feel like you think I’m simple and stupid.  Of course I speculated and pulled all that myself.  Just maybe similar to other peoples feelings to some degree?  Some people suffer from insomnia permanently due to nuanced reasons.  Insomnia is sort of a blanket term for chronic sleep problems that a lot of the time can be secondary to another problem.  So it’s kind of like someone saying just stop being tired and go to bed, you can’t sleep because you don’t try."

If you don't want to try medication for insomnia, then use something that won't wake you up when he goes to bed. Perhaps a mattress that stops any motion through it. Try ear plugs, if it's noise that bothers you. Definitely tell him to use a flashlight on low brightness when he comes to bed, so no light wakes you up. He should try to be as quiet and least disruptive as possible (which is probably already the case I presume)."

I went to a sleep psychologist as well, didn't really try any weird strategies, just kept a sleep journal &amp; learned about sleep hygiene. Unfortunately didn't work. I actually even quit drinking caffeine over a year ago &amp; I truly thought that would make a big dent, but..nah. I've only met one other person irl that had just as bad sleep issues, but theirs was due to PTSD after serving in the military, and they were on a few different sleeping pills to deal with it. Idk about you, but I've really been holding off on going down the pill route, there's just so many side effects, I don't want to turn one crappy problem into a new even crappier problem. I do feel like at the core, my sleep issues are related to anxiety, so effectively dealing with that is probably the direction to go down, but it's so hard /whine. Boston is a great city, I hope you are enjoying living there! I haven't been there in ages, but I remember it fondly, especially during the fall season. I appreciate your commiseration, it can get lonely living with this bs when everyone else around seems to have no issues. Yeah, I'm determined, but tbh I'm not super optimistic. I'm still holding out some hope, but just not expecting much. A small improvement would be pretty awesome."

After the initial stressful period; I felt no stress in my day to day life, I was happy, but I still had to take sleep meds to sleep. 

Now, any stressful thing means I will have bad sleep for 2-3 weeks that I have to control with increased meds and it's so infuriating."

If anything it seems worse that it was before. People without insomnia have no idea what it’s like to function “like normal” without sleep. I would say the first three days are tolerable. Once day 4 starts though I almost feel drunk, unable to process simple daily tasks, have frequent out of body experiences, and my nervous system goes haywire.

For the last 3 weeks I can't stay asleep for more than 2 hours at a time....
I'm hoping I'll be over it in the next month...
But to answer your question, yes it can help you fall asleep if you smoke any indica strain. But if you get hooked and decide to quit, your insomnia will be worse than ever.
I'd say use it very very sparingly.... 
Even if you only smoke once a night, it can become addictive. I hope you find relief."

I started out just asking him to lay down with me for a while at night to chat, etc.  then he slowly started coming to bed a little earlier all the time and now we have the same sleep schedule.

It was the mental part/not being able to think straight that I struggled with the most. I, like you, would so much love to be able to get up in the morning and be able to function like most other adults. 

I worked with a sleep psychologist at UCSD in San Diego for a year and we tried sleep restriction. It didn’t go well for me. It feels like my brain so hard wired at this point. Idk. I think other people offered more hopeful success stories in that regard so good luck attempting it if you do. I think it’s so hard for anyone who has never struggled with severe, chronic insomnia to understand so this forum is good for atleast finding people who know exactly how you feel. Thanks for your empathy and suggestions. I live in Boston so it’s a big enough big city with its urban areas and suburbs. But skills and qualifications and actually wanting to do third shift...a whole other story. But I digress in talking about me. lol 

I really just wanted you to know that I can absolutely relate to your experience and how much of an impact insomnia can have one’s emotional well being. It’s maddening! I hope people can offer more concrete suggestions or you might find other ideas even just scouring through the rest of this sub. You seem determined."

Personally my body responds better to medicine that's usually used to treat seizures, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and panic disorder. 

As for the Adderall, have you ever considered taking Vyvanse instead? That may work better for you. It works better for me, I've got terrible ADHD. I can't do Adderall. I was on Adderall once for 3 days and didn't sleep a wink the entire time. On day 3 I started hallucinating it was **awful**. They immediately took me off it. Switched to Vyvanse.

For both indic and sativa I had noticeably improved sleep if I took them around 5ish (after work) so they were starting to wear off about the time I want to bed (11ish).

According to my Oura (sleep tracking ring) I average 5.25 hours almost exactly if I'm not taking THC, however it's very variable night to night.   Some nights 4, others more.  It's hard to set a routine and very fragile.  

The month of THC I averaged 7ish hours and didn't have to be nearly as OCD about my sleep hygiene.   It made me realize how easy it is for some people like my wife.

I would just urge you to talk to atleast talk to someone about alternatives that may work for you. Also, I did see a sleep psychologist. Again, I had no luck but it could be different for you.

That being said, every now and then I have just a really, really, hard time waking up and I'm not sure why. The only thing I can think about is, I use edibles so, I think if I eat late, it slows down the absorption so, I've tried to make it a point to eat earlier or take the edibles earlier.

My psychiatrist, and every other health care professional I've talked to about it, highly discourages me using it to help sleep. I'm on a few medications to help me sleep but, even on those, I was still having a hard time getting to sleep so, I started using weed again. The combination of prescriptions + weed, so far (knock on wood), has been a golden ticket to getting me into dreamland after yearsssss of insomnia. The last time I talked to my psychiatrist about it she just said it would be better to use something with equal CBD so, I started getting CBD tablets."

1. If you want to try it, try it on a night where you don’t have to anything the next day just in case you do get a hangover. I’ve heard some people do, but have never experienced it myself.

2. I didn’t realize that you can get addicted in the sense where, if you use it daily for sleep like I do, it makes it damn near impossible to sleep without it. It’s been a godsend for me, but at the same time, I can’t really sleep without it now (this is after maybe 5 years of smoking a small bowl every night before bed). Just something to be aware of.

Ive been on the weirdest sleep schedules you can imagine for over a decade, and seeing you using sentences like ""seems like a distant fantasy"" reminds me of myself thinking the same, so many times.. its like living in an altered state of mind.

What made me change is the unavoidable obligation to work. Before that i used to work at late shifts in another place, but once i had to find a new job i couldnt afford myself living like that anymore, i had to be available earlier, so for a week or so before i started the new job i would get prepared mentally to that and change my schedule by not sleeping the first night (and day) or getting only a little of sleep, like 2-3 hours and then try and go to bed earlier (which is like at 2 or 3) and wake up early at 6 or 7 due to my shitty sleeping issues.. that day i would distract myself as much as possible from feeling like shit and all of those no sleep side effects by playing video games for hours and drinking coffine early that day. When night time comes ill lay down at around 22:00 23:00 expacting nothing tbh since i had many failed trys like this before, but i eventually fall asleep for 3-4 hours this time waking up at like 3 or 4 repeating the same shit i did the day before.. so its basiclly its like that for almost a week untill i sleep for atleast 6 hours during the night due to exhaustion from previous days of little sleep until it becomes a new standard that being supported by the obligation of the job.

The only thing that worked for me were those over the counter nasal sprays. But those aren't good either because you get physically dependent almost immediately and suffer rebound congestion the next day as a result. 

If your nasal congestion continues for longer than a week then consider asking your doc about a different yet similar drug, such as amitriptyline. Equally safe and no stuffy nose (at least for me)."

At this point so I don’t mentally tire myself in the event I can’t sleep, I stop all homework and things that require active thought by 11 pm. If I can’t sleep, I only watch stuff like American dad or bobs burgers bc it’s mindless. I think that’s the only way I’m able to kinda think the next day. It’s not the recharge I want but hey, it’s better than nothing. Maybe if you’re finding yourself going on for several days you can do the same, but shorten the window a bit to help mitigate mental strain? 
One thing that I do for tests to calm my nerves is smile a lot before it, because it raises dopamine levels. I might try that a bit because dopamine can help with stress, and honestly I don’t know what else could be causing my sleep issues. Also maybe working out 1-2 before bed time could be an option.

As for doctors, insomniacs are tough clients, since they know they can't really help them, other than refer them to a shrink, or prescribe some short acting drugs.

In terms of drugs they don't fix the problem. 

Ambien is good if you can't fall asleep but it's short acting so no good if staying asleep is a problem. Has she ever tried Zopiclone, it's the same class of drug as Ambien but longer half life so keep her asleep. 

Clonazepam here in the UK isn't used for insomnia so not sure how effective it is. Personally after over a decade of various treatments I rotate between Zopiclone, diazepam and nitrazepam. Take one of them for two or three nights to get into a routine then in a few weeks when insomnia gets bad again I do the same with another one. This way I haven't built tolerance or dependence issues. 

Zopiclone is the best all round it will give me 7 or 8 hours sleep and feel pretty fresh, only side effect is a strange metal taste next day. Diazepam is also good, but long half life so can feel a bit hungover when first get up. 

Nitrazepam is the best at knocking you out, it literally knocks me out for about 10 hours but major downside is the long half life, really feel it the next day still. So I only use that if don't have work the next morning or have to do anything. 

Therepy would be a good start, it got me to the point of not needing pills daily."

I’m not personally groggy in the morning after smoking weed at night, and I like to go for a run or to clear my head in the morning anyway. If you have insomnia, I’d definitely give it a shot. CBD works well too, possibly better if sleep is the main goal."
2609,hc3ka0c,,,insomnia,1631130770,"It absolutely does, but on the other hand, if you start using it on a daily basis, unless you're very tired because of what you've done during the day, smoking without it will feel like crazy."

2612,hc3hr16,,,insomnia,1631129747,I wouldn’t take Sudafed before bed. It can keep you awake. I never noticed a stuffy nose with trazodone but read that it is one of the side effects. I would stay on it a little longer to see if it goes away.
2613,hc3hpjr,,,insomnia,1631129731,"I haven’t slept more lately than 2 hours for the last 2 days. I’m able to function during the day, not great of course. 

I’d just avoid driving if possible."
2614,hc3gz9x,,,insomnia,1631129428,"Dosage is key. Too much can give you anxiety, and too little might leave you frustrated. I believe eating it is best, a couple hours before bed."
2615,hc3g4jo,,,insomnia,1631129072,I also have had insomnia since taking first shot Pfizer. Did you only take the first shot?
2616,hc3f7ne,,,insomnia,1631128693,Yes. Dispensaries now have accessible to them the cannabinoid CBN It promotes restful sleep.
2617,hc3f37p,,,insomnia,1631128641,"i don’t like using cannabis recreationally because it makes me anxious, but yes it absolutely helps with sleep. i’ve been dealing with insomnia for a few months. after looking into other sleep meds, it seems like they all have their pitfalls. i chose to go with the more ‘natural’ option. my hope is that, with responsible use, once i am less stressed i’ll be able to sleep without it.

if you want to avoid the psychoactive effects, try starting off with pure cbd."

Most experts say turn your phone off like an hour before bed and keep off all night.  Instead do something relaxing screen free for a good hour before bed.

There's many other effective ideas such as keeping a very consistent wake time, but that depends on what's causing your insomnia."
2626,hc365w9,,,insomnia,1631124976,Yes. More so when you don't have a tolerance to it. It helps less and less as your tolerance builds. It's why I started smoking it regularly and now it doesn't do a whole hell of a lot.

2633,hc32cpr,,,insomnia,1631123397,What about edibles?
2634,hc32a89,,,insomnia,1631123368,"There is no evidence it helps sleep, primarily because the cannabinoid neurotransmitters aren't involved with sleep onset or maintenance.  

Some use it to help control anxiety and stress, but cannabis for some worsens those issues and can be problematic.

Maybe more importantly, those who do use it for sleep are only treating the symptom and not the actual underlying cause for the sleep disruption.

For sleep improvement, there are better ways."
2635,hc3221g,,,insomnia,1631123276,A lot but I don't recommend since when you get used to it you can't sleep without it and imo it's more dangerous

2642,hc2samq,,,insomnia,1631119280,"Unlikely the vitamin C is causing sleep disruption.  Far more likely excessive stress is.

Try ramping up stress management best you can while you recover.  Planning a good hour before bed to just de-stress, relax, and unwind is a good idea.  Screen free."

2645,hc2rtc1,,,insomnia,1631119083,"A full solution usually involves first determining if there's any untreated med issues.  See your doc for that.  If none, which is usually the case at your age especially, then use of a CBT sleep training system gives you the hygiene + many other substance free methods.

In the meantime, avoiding those all nighters is a step in the right direction.  You'll probably do yourself a favor by establishing a very consistent wake time every morning without sleeping in or napping later.  That alone helps assure you'll get drowsy the night following at a more reasonable time."
2646,hc2qh4m,,,insomnia,1631118540,"The tired but wired + the jolting awake at the moment of falling asleep = agreed, absolute worst aspect of insomnia.  Many of us can relate.

But better to not dwell incessantly on that -- there are solutions that work and battling back the negativity is usually part of that.  

When you're ready to move on, see:  CBT sleep training systems if you haven't already."
2647,hc2psjo,,,insomnia,1631118262,I am glad to know that I am not the only one. These things also interfere sometimes during the day... but it intensifies while trying to sleep.

I would take it, then I would get restless, anxious, sweaty, uncontrollable spasms in my body and a stuffy nose that would make me feel like I was drowning. Not saying don’t take it! Everyone is different. It saved my sleepless nights for many years. Who knows maybe my body/brain changed and I suddenly didn’t react the same anymore."
2649,hc2o54s,,,insomnia,1631117583,"Ugh I had to get off of trazodone for a few reasons but I think that was my final straw of that med. I was on traz for about 8 years and it worked great for all of those years and them BAM. It started with the sweats and felt like jolts would go through my body and I literally couldn’t control them. And the stuffy nose would make me feel like I was drowning and I would spiral into panicking. Needless to say, I got off this med quick once those things started. Now on Mirtazapine 30 mg and never felt better!"

2655,hc2im4m,,,insomnia,1631115257,"Yes, you are correct. In that case, the product is completely useless. Pure placebo, as far as sleep goes. But, potentially dangerous for other side-effects, especially if you take to much. Also, the biggest problem with supplements is that the dose (and even ingredients) can vary widely from what the label says is in it.

IMO, these kinds of products should be illegal. They should be classified as a drug, and made to provide evidence that they actually work. Also, dosage should be controlled."

The sheer frequency of which I think about putting my gun to my head and pulling the trigger has forced me to take it apart and give my barrel to someone else until further notice. I've got no other reason to end my life and honestly, I can't even understand how this alone is making me want to kill myself. But on the other hand, there's the nausea, chest pains, body aches, dizziness, depression, and this strange mental haze that I can't really describe.. All that's well and good but to carry on like this for years with only a one-night respite every few months... Anyone here already knows the agony... The doctors I've seen have been laughably apathetic. They really could give a shit (but in fairness, everyone's stressed and overtaxed nowadays). One even prescribed me something known to increase suicidal thoughts after a 10 minute first consult. But aside from that, I have every reason to live in gratitude otherwise...

I was on it in my 20s and don't remember why I kicked it then, but my psychiatrist and I decided to try it again, about a year ago. It helped a little with my insomnia, starting at 100mg and increasing to 300mg. It stopped working all together after a few months. Also had some sexual side effects as a woman, just not into sex or reaching climax. Definitely went away once we titrated off it. (We have it on board for a PRN for breakthrough insomnia, but I think it hurts me more than helps). 

Folks are right though- older safer antidepressant and very very cheap. It does work wonders for some!"

I can barely function when this happens, it’s draining all my energy and happiness. I was hooked on watching the news and podcasts about Covid and the worlds problems, so I ditched all that a few weeks ago to lower my stress, also I was drinking a glass of wine every night and taking Ambien, so I stopped the wine and now I only take a small dose of Ambien which I am try to taper off. I want to be off of drugs, and just sleep normal. Last night I got six hours, interrupted and light, but at least I feel somewhat alive. The night before….nada! No sleep at all! My husband can’t believe I can even function the day after no sleep….it really is torture. I have gone up to four nights in a row. That’s when I get suicidal thoughts. I am starting to use an app called “Sleep coach”. Wish me luck."
2675,hc1zukx,,,insomnia,1631106989,Wow.. I think you are right that its mostly frustration needing a target. Good point. I guess I also need to calm my mind before I jump to bed.

I know how much insomnia sucks and how you can feel that you are willing to try anything out of desperation, but I'd pass on this."

2678,hc1w18z,,,insomnia,1631105043,Dry mouth is a common one. I had to keep a glass of water next to my bed at night.
2679,hc1vtd2,,,insomnia,1631104925,I had side effects on it. Dry mouth through the night and a headache in the morning. My issue was anxiety related. Having panic attacks at night that’s why I couldn’t sleep. I’m on lexapro now sleeping better and don’t need Trazodone anymore. Fingers crossed it continues to work. But Trazodone did do it’s job. It did help me sleep but after a while you need more. I would take it as needed. What it did for me was make me sleep one night with side effects then I was so tired the next day I didn’t need it the next night. It’s honestly better then insomnia. Lesser of two evils at least you’ll get some sleep. So yes it’s worth it. Anything is better then not sleeping. Just keep some Advil or Tylenol on hand for the morning after. You get over the headache after you take something.
2680,hc1vg6d,,,insomnia,1631104728,"Wow, our circumstances and chronic insomnia sound super similar. I’m also a 20 y/o Junior in college who has chronic insomnia and sleep deprivation. I haven’t slept more than 4 hours these last couple of weeks and I only get that much if I’m on a 24 hour sleep deficit. Midterms are coming up and my memory is extremely impaired. Im afraid I’ll flunk out. It’s comforting to know I’m not going through it alone. Use sleeping pills as a very last resort because I think my chronic insomnia is due to sleeping medication dependence.

2681,hc1t5bm,,,insomnia,1631103437,"If this is something that you know bothers you why not change the type sheets you use and/or sleepwear (or lack of)?  Prep that bed to perfection before you even climb in!     

I think when we are frustrated by lack of sleep we latch on to any annoyance to justify our issue- whether it's a wrinkled sheet or it's one degree too warm, or someone is breathing, lol.  
I know I feel like the Princess and the Pea sometimes with regard to wrinkled up clothing.   

So I think it's *mostly*  just frustration needing a target with a little bit of ""wrinkles are annoying"" thrown in. I know when I am utterly exhausted I can sleep anywhere. It's just the sleepless nights that bring out all our quirks."

2712,hc147ed,,,insomnia,1631083168,"Well you want 8 hours of sleep, so if you determine when you want to wake up each morning subtract 8 hours and that's your new bedtime. How long it takes for you to get used to it depends on each person"
2713,hc144fx,,,insomnia,1631083101,I was on it for about 5 weeks. Finally stopped taking it and was able to sleep last night! Going back to Paxil for now but I’ve heard good things about Zoloft
2714,hc0r1a8,,,insomnia,1631074202,Only 8 hours? If I don't sleep 10 hours a night I can't wake up! I'll try taking it with water because I have nothing better... Only melatonin binaural beat and a cold room.
2715,hc0my2s,,,insomnia,1631071932,"unfortunately nothing too miraculous. there are a couple directories of CBTi providers that i think are worth perusing as many of them are able to do it via telehealth. the problem, in almost all cases, is that these providers do not take insurance. generally you have to submit a claim to your insurance company and i typically see insurance companies cover about 50% of the cost, if they cover anything. this still totals to 300-400 dollars for the patient for a full course.

https://cbti.directory/

certainly i think the treatment and resolution of months, sometimes years, of chronic insomnia may be worth that amount of money. but  i am of the belief it needs to be more accessible and far more affordable. app based CBTi is a step in the right direction, but these apps preferably should have a therapist you can meet with once a week or so... sleepio (i'm not associated with them) does this, but is not generally available to the public unless they are doing research studies.

all in all i strongly recommend CBTi and i encourage people with insomnia to at least read about it. sometimes just the shift in mindset is enough to kickstart some improvement."
2716,hc0l870,,,insomnia,1631071017,100mg worked for me for about a month. Then I was back to waking up after 2-3 hours and not being able to go back to sleep. Dr. Just started me on 6mg doxepin and so far it's the best results I've had.
2717,hc0l4yc,,,insomnia,1631070969,I have absolutely no idea about that one. There are different frequencies that are supposed to help with different things though.
2718,hc0kvpl,,,insomnia,1631070834,"Ya, melatonin does very little and will make you drowsy upon awakening if you don't get the full 8 hours of sleep. I can't recall where I read this, but if you take it with a full glass of water it is supposed to work better, and does for me. But I slept alright considering I had nothing else to help."
2719,hc0ix9c,,,insomnia,1631069811,"I was prescribed it for sleep and I woke up feeling hung-over and in a daze all day.
Hated it."
2720,hc0gg8y,,,insomnia,1631068550,Checking in. Are things any different today?
2721,hc0gfzb,,,insomnia,1631068546,I got the same Issue here I gave my self insomnia By worrying and the worrying gave me anxiety.

2725,hc0dqcb,,,insomnia,1631067204,It's hard though because I've fanatically absorbed 'good sleep hygiene' and never nap. But rethinking it now!
2726,hc0ca2s,,,insomnia,1631066499,"You might be able to fix this by setting a very consistent wake time in the morning.  If you keep that without sleeping in at all or napping later, over the course of several weeks that will reset your circadian rhythm and you'll begin to feel drowsy enough for sleep at a more reasonable bedtime.

Wake time is key to fixing this."
2727,hc0bf8k,,,insomnia,1631066098,Yeah I was thinking about that earlier. I think they’ve helped in the past. I’m going to look out for some tomorrow. Thanks!
2728,hc0b9ls,,,insomnia,1631066024,Have you considered using ear plugs for the loud sounds that wake you up? Some people have great success with that.
2729,hc0apnq,,,insomnia,1631065767,"Besides drinking to fall asleep, do you use large amounts of caffeine during the day? Caffeine has an incredible half life. Meaning if you have your last cup of coffee in the morning at 9.00am, you still have 50% of the caffeine up until around 5.00pm.

A close friend would do similar, stay up for days, drink pots of coffee and cans of energy drinks to stay awake. Then finally would crash and sleep 12-16 hours. It wears on the immune system and wreaks havoc with the mind.

I would absolutely limit your caffeine immediately. Then look to something physically exhausting such as swimming. 

I would not recommend taking Ambien, but would highly suggest taking a couple of Benadryl. Take it on an empty stomach, with a drink if you must. It’ll help you build a healthier sleep routine."
2730,hc0a8yt,,,insomnia,1631065561,"I’m in the UK, we don’t generally have A/C and the noise of the fan would wake my partner. It’s a no win situation!"

2732,hc08mqf,,,insomnia,1631064806,"Not a downer at all, this is where you can go when you're having trouble sleeping. If you've been dealing with this for over 2 months, I'd recommend seeing a psychiatrist. You may have a sleeping disorder, but it may also just be stress. Don't go jumping into any conclusions on your own. Definitely see a professional first.

You sound like you may be dealing with a lot and the stress from all those things could be ruining your sleep but it's also possible you have an unhealthy sleeping pattern, or you consume too much caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. Because of all the possible reasons, that's why it's better to see a professional. We can give you tips but we can't give you much more than that."

2735,hc074wb,,,insomnia,1631064109,I think the herbal Nytol is an antihistamine too. It just doesn’t make me drowsy enough. Good luck!
2736,hc073hi,,,insomnia,1631064091,thank you i appreciate it. and ive started smoking ever since i dropped out but my tolerance is so high that even bong hits wont help me. it also doesn’t help me sleep ive only gotten high on “sleepy” indica before it stopped getting me high completely. trust me ive tried even tho i have asthma attack lol. ive been so desperate to get high lately especially with no sleep but i dont have much other options right now because im not 18 yet.
2737,hc06udh,,,insomnia,1631063973,My sleep problems started two days ago after being affected by flooding due to Ida.  My house is in upheaval… also I took a thc losenge to relax and had a horrible trip on it.  I don’t know what’s going on.
2738,hc062ug,,,insomnia,1631063619,"Try Piriton and let me know how you get on, it’s obviously not for insomnia, however, the side effect is drowsiness and makes you sleep. Not supposed to be used for sleeping but if it works, it works right? The heat isn’t helping, I have a fan on me and it’s uncomfortable because it either got too cold or too hot , there’s no happy medium for me.

I can't guarantee I'll be able to respond all the time, but I'm having a really hard time as well. I've tried so many things to to no avail. The only thing that's got me by, and literally got me by, is Ativan 1mg, sometimes 1.5, combined with medical marijuana and 1000mg of Depakote. It's fucked up, all of this is. Idk why we have to go through these things. I'm sending you as much love as I can. I know how hard this is. I'm sorry. But once more, just know you're not alone within the flames."
2740,hc055i8,,,insomnia,1631063186,"This seems overwhelming, but just take one step at a time.  Start with the first step.

Be honest with your prescribing doctor.  

You might benefit from working with an MD who specializes in sleep in addition to your psychiatrist.  The sleep doc might be able to give you additional tools that will help at least with the sleep portion.

Be confident there are solutions that work, and that and you will find them."

2742,hc04mcy,,,insomnia,1631062939,Never be sorry for dealing with this hell. I've been going through intense sleep issues for 5 years straight now and it's hard to keep going. You're not alone.

2744,hc03hf9,,,insomnia,1631062412,about 4 days because my doctor wouldn’t answer.
2745,hc038b9,,,insomnia,1631062294,Yep. About the same amount of sleep here. The panic about the hours passing by but still being wide awake is grim

It is all psychological but the noisy little walking heater isn’t helping."
2749,hbzzm8f,,,insomnia,1631060613,"Honestly, insomnia is mostly mental. It's about anxiety and frustration with trying to sleep and not being able to. Too much negative thinking. A cat purring and sleeping next to you actually sounds pretty nice and cozy. I bet a lot of people would love to sleep like that. Just try not to get worked up so much over everything, because it only makes things worse. Try to accept it, embrace it, and make the best out of it. Just remain positive. Changing your mindset and doing CBT plays a big part in Insomnia."
2750,hbzxy4g,,,insomnia,1631059840,True but both would achieve the same sleepless night in different ways. Granted purring is gentler on the ears
2751,hbzxsgg,,,insomnia,1631059766,Could be worse. Could have loud barking dogs :p
2752,hbzxl5h,,,insomnia,1631059671,"Do you have a way of winding down and relaxing at night? As in you shouldn't be doing things that stimulate your mind, no blue light, etc. I read a book called say good night to insomnia. That book helped me somewhat, but I haven't 100% implemented all the techniques yet.  Are you in a completely dark and silent room?"
2753,hbzxks7,,,insomnia,1631059666,yea im stuck for now because ive been sick from the 400mg for the past two weeks and i have to wait 2 more till i can see my doctor again. because im not sure of what else to do. good luck to you tho.
2754,hbzxahx,,,insomnia,1631059531,"Thanks. Sorry to hear it got worse in your case... I hope at least now you are getting a bit better, maybe finding what helps you sleep etc. Meow"
2755,hbzwhey,,,insomnia,1631059153,u should really get checked for it because i let myself not sleep for days at a time for nearly 3 years (which i know yourse not doing but even the few hours of sleep i used to be able to sleep exactly 2-3 hour like u after about 4 days) and now im on my 7th year of being an insomniac. i left the hallucinations alone intoll i went to a psychiatrist this year and found out ive  had schizophrenia (even before my insomnia started) and i was told my insomnia made it worse because i was always manic. just be careful maybe try melatonin gummy’s if youre not a fan of pills. or even sleepy tea. im just recommending even tho they dont work for me.
2756,hbzvvwf,,,insomnia,1631058871,didnt help me at all in fact when they took me off it and tried to put me back on the meds that did help me before but it made my insomnia worse to the point 400mg of seroquel does nothing for me anymore. and now im trying to search for something else because i havent slept for days.
2757,hbzvjv7,,,insomnia,1631058714,youll be fine just dont let it become a daily thing because i let that happen to me and now ive been insomniac for 7 years and i can go days without sleep for days. just be careful. i have schizophrenia and not sleeping makes all my hallucinations/visions worse and it was actually proven to worsen my schizophrenia since then. (ive had it before ive had insomnia)
2758,hbzv3mz,,,insomnia,1631058506,"Things are slowly getting better for me but it took a lot of time even now I'm not 100% but at least the insomnia is mostly gone (I had bad insomnia for a little over a month then it started to subside). I still have random jerks before I fall asleep but not like the beginning. Try and keep yourself as calm as possible (i know its hard) before bed. Try some night sleep teas, yoga, meditation, no electronics before bed, try to walk before going to bed. Basically anything to relax our already hyperactive immune system. Try magnesium glycinate which helps with insomnia and anxiety and melatonin helps me too. Things will get better! Hang in there"
2759,hbzuxu7,,,insomnia,1631058431,It helped me alot. I dont take it every night though. Just when I know I need to catch up on sleep. Crazy dreams for sure. I wouldn't take it if you need to be awake at a certain time definitely take it when you need like 8 or more hours of sleep.

 I also can't sleep in total silence j need something like water running that's why rain helps, or a fan or the air conditioner 

I'm totally trying binaural beats tonight. 

Melatonin makes me drouzy in the morning and doesn't really help me sleep. I mean it's not magic. So I don't prefer it. Do u have the same problem? Any tips on how to make it go away?"
2765,hbzkhaa,,,insomnia,1631053646,don't binaural beats lose their encoding when they are compressed into mp3s? I was told you needed FLAC files or the actual cd

Yes, the side effects went away when I stopped taking trazodone."

2777,hbzblga,,,insomnia,1631049596,"Understandable, and there are alternative therapies that can sometimes work for some people (such as CBT-i).  But, if your insomnia is bad for very long periods, then you have to weigh the downside of pills vs. the downside of life-long chronic insomnia. For most people, chronic insomnia is going to screw you up way more than pills, over the long-term.

If you're only having insomnia for a short time, then yes, just suffer through it. You don't need pills in that case."

I’m a little groggy in the morning but it’s easier to shake off than the morning haze from other things I’ve tried to help with sleep, like weed or melatonin (neither of which actually helped improve my quality of sleep). 

Personally, I would try it to see if it works for you and if it doesn’t help perhaps it just isn’t for you. With that said I’m probably far less skeptical of pharmaceuticals seeing as I take an antidepressant and adhd meds as well. 

In any case, good luck and happy sleeping!"

The lesson I learned over the years is to accept the fact that I will not fall asleep naturally just like healthy people. So instead of waiting for myself to fall asleep, I start the drills of getting myself into the deep relaxation state. Once I am in that deep relaxation state, I just fall asleep quickly and unintentionally."
2794,hbypuvg,,,insomnia,1631040674,A lot of people have success with it.  I was not one of those people but the side effects were minimal (dry mouth mostly).  I would give it a try!

Basically, expect it to stick around in your system all night, and most of the next day if you're on the long-end of the range. It should be gone by bedtime the following night.

BTW, the other herbal stuff is useless. Don't bother with it, or at least don't pay much for it. All you're getting is a placebo."

2809,hby7mcr,,,insomnia,1631033132,"Could be some sort of circadian rhythm disruption, but key from a sleep standpoint is your bedtime.  What time, and is it consistent?  

Possible that you're allowing too much time in bed, hard to say.  

If it's gone on longer than a month, probably time to see a doc.  If less than a month, you might try a very consistent sleep schedule that only allows the min time in bed you need for proper sleep and no more.  Usually keeping a very consistent wake time without sleeping in is one key to better sleep."

The bigger issue is the fatigue and depression, which  may or may not be sleep  related..  Suggest you consult with a primary care doc to either treat or rule out any underlying med issue.

If none, then you might try using a CBT sleep training system to help improve your overall sleep quality."

Why?  Because your physiologic requirement for sleep is stronger than your insomnia.  At some point the urge/need/requirement for sleep overwhelms the insomnia.

Nothing else in my room was like that, just on the screen. It was the same tv show/episode that I always watch, so it didn't change to something else. It was really trippy.

2846,hbxiiex,,,insomnia,1631022498,"I have the same problem. I'm trying a lot of new things to help. One thing I've been doing is going outside as soon as I wake up and get some sun and go for a little walk for at least 10 mins. Then around sunset or an hour before, I get some more sun and try to watch the light get dimmer outside. Doing both of those things will help set your sleep cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been turning off all lights, sounds, and electronics when I'm in bed. I've been so used to falling asleep to a tv show on my laptop and it's always comforted me, but I think I sleep better in complete silence and darkness. My brain gets enough audio/light stimulation during the day, so at night it really needs to shut off and not receive anything. Exercise helps too, but that isn't easy when you're tired and have no energy in the day, I know. I've just really been trying to stay off electronics and stimulating my mind too much and going outside in nature more. I heard people talk about how they go camping for a week with no electronics and they go to sleep when sun goes down and wake up when sun rises and they feel refreshed and great sleep. We gotta slow the pace of our life down and cut out all the stress, over stimulation, and electronic screens in our face all day.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say experiment and keep trying different things until you find something that works. I also drink chamomile tea an hour or 2 before bed."
2847,hbxf2td,,,insomnia,1631020818,"Ok. It helps to allow yourself enough time after work to wind down and relax, you might benefit from going to bed later.

2851,hbxbfpc,,,insomnia,1631018901,"Long term insomniac here. 

The problem won't go away on its own. Insomnia has dug its claws into you and those claws are growing roots and digging deeper. Hopeful and wishful thinking doesn't work. Neither does ""sleep hygiene"". 

When you reach this level of desperation you need to go see a doctor. If the first doctor doesn't work out (like mine did), go find another one. If that one doesn't work out (ditto) go find another one until the right meds are prescribed.

I know exactly how you feel and I've been in your exact spot many times. You mustn't give up on yourself. Fight it like its a parasite. It is sucking the life out of you and you can only combat it with the same level of determination.

Some small tips for your journey:
- don't dwell on the negatives. try as best as you can to think positive and be grateful for what you have. Negativity feeds the cycle.
- find a doctor you trust and when you find him or her, put your faith into whatever advice you're given
- sleep will come. it's always there waiting. right now you have an obstacle in the way and you just need to break that wall down.

Good luck. We're all in this together."

* blackout curtains
* eyemask
* earplugs
* weighted blanket
* open window most of the year (when it's too hot in summer I can't do this but I keep the AC on pretty high.
* My husband sleeps in a separate room because any movement or noise will wake me up and he snores so loud I can hear him through my earplugs from two floors away.
* When I come home from work I always go up to wash my face (otherwise I often forget and sleep with makeup which is no bueno), and at that time I make sure to take all my vitamins (I'm always Vit D deficient to I take 6000 iui a day, Mag +B6, fish oil)
* If I am going through a stressful period I take a Xanax at about 7 pm (small dose 0.25 mg); if I feel I'm in a good place this is replaced with a Valerian/chamomile/hops combo pill that I found that works well in periods of no/low stress.
* go up to my room at the same time every night (9:30); no devices after that.
* take my Quetiapine (I am now on 25 mg but in periods of low stress I can go down to 12 mg). 
* Read until about 10:30. 
* Usually by then I am nodding off so I just turn off all lights and put my eye mask on and sleep.

I use the Quetiapine and xanax to carry me through periods of high stress (recently I had to send my kids back to in person school because my telework arrangement has been revoked so I now also have to go into the office so my insomnia came back with a vengeance after having been pretty under control for a while) so I had up increase the Quetiapine and add the xanax.  After a couple weeks of good sleep I am now off the xanax and on the lower dose of Quetiapine but now I know to not wait until I haven't slept in three days before doing that but rather acknowledge that I'm stressed and increase the meds earlier.  

My insomnia is clearly anxiety based, but once my body has had 2-3 nights of no sleep it's about breaking the physical cycle even if the stress is gone."

But I know I want to challenge myself. Every night before the game I would get insomnia. Sometimes not even get a single minute of sleep. I am happy to report that yesterday I got a good 6 hours before I had to get up early and head out to play. 

I tried a technique I had seen somewhere and it works perfectly. Usually you cannot sleep because you get obsessed with a question or idea or like in my case get anxiety and stress. You need to distract your mind. So I close my eyes and start naming every object in my room. I even do that for different rooms in my house if I feel like I am running through a known list instead of trying to visualize and name the objects in a room. Obviously I am doing this in my head while lying in sleeping position. But it works. It takes a lot of focus but if you keep at it, you will sleep before you know it.

I have been woken up by my toddler and have had to do this from scratch. But it works if you focus really hard. It distracts you from the thought giving you anxiety. 

I have tried medicines but they never seem to work and make me hot, which is worse when I am trying to fall asleep."

I started at like 50mg I think and at some point got to 100mg. I hit 200mg because one I was 60lbs heavier and 2 I used it as an additional antidepressant. 

Here is something you can do if you think you need more to sleep instead of just going for a higher dose all the time. Get a pill cutter and cut a pill in half if you think you need more that night. If you feel like you are not getting sleepy in a reasonable amount of time like within an hour of taking the normal dose take the half dose. 

The side effect I was having at the higher does was that it would cause my nasal passages to close up at night making sleeping hard. Cutting back really helped with that."

2949,hbtzhf9,,,insomnia,1630950329,"Sorry to hear you're struggling. I battle insomnia as well. Been that way since I was a kid, has gotten worse in adulthood, more pronounced in times of stress. But I've found certain things have helped me. I know I may live with this the rest of my life, but my acceptance of it has been a big help. First, recognize that the lack of sleep is hurting your own body's ability to repair itself, to help heal the brain...so try to engage in soft activities that will help it when you can't sleep. On those days, during the day, try meditating or Yin Yoga sequence (you can find some on YouTube). Try to get some direct sunlight for vitamin D. Basically try to be easy on yourself after sleepless nights. If you can, invest in good pillows, sheets, blanket that you find extra comfortable. Remove friction points in your sleep ritual. After I bought a better mattress, with all of the above....it didn't eliminate my difficulty but it eased one point of previous difficulty. Same with room temperature and light. The idea is, try to make it as comfortable as possible. At night, I take 25mg of CBD and 400mg of Gabapentin. At the same time every night, an hour or two before intended sleep time, to help bring some ease to the inevitable tension and negative association of sleep.  I also take 5 mg melatonin and magnesium glycinate supplements, which I take together about an hour after the previous two. A high amount of us who struggle with sleep have some kind of magnesium deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, etc. For me that combo, has been working after going through some pretty severe crises over the last two years. I'm sleeping. And hopefully you'll find what works for you. It's important to heal that panic brain that develops in sleep deficiency. That negative association. To rest. And once you do, even for one night or two...to develop some better daytime habits. I saw a noticeable difference when I started exercising daily. Even 30 minutes, but high intensity until I'm tired. That and when I reduced my idiotic behaviors like gaming until the wee hours. It's not like I became a monk. Think nudge, not overnight revolution..but keeping a book and dim light by nightstand. Having a time when you turn off screens, no led lights. The combination of the supplements with the behavior modifications has helped a lot. I don't think it's any one thing. For me, it's all of them. And when you do struggle, and it's 4 am, do a little yin yoga next to your bed, read a bit, try to not get desperate. And be easy on yourself the next day so your cortisol levels don't spike even more. A little yoga, things that don't require too much. Tell people so they know not to expect too much. And you give it a try the next day. But it can get better. Hope this helps."
2950,hbtqwhz,,,insomnia,1630946624,Quitting medication cold can kill and also produce rebound anxiety that can be much worse than the initial state.
2951,hbtp86g,,,insomnia,1630945899,"I felt the stigma as well. I also felt as if I did not have the power or will to overcome my problems without medicine, to be precise , sleep medicine. I'm not trying to stigmatize medicine in general. I would not go under a knife with pain killers or refuse antibiotics. My focus is on sleep medicine.

When I say , this is not medical advice. I mean that I'm not the authority on this topic and my opinions should not be taken as facts. There's always the possibility that a statement can be misconstrued as mine undoubtedly was, maybe it was of no fault of the reader, maybe it was that ,  it was expected that context would lend some meaning to what was written. Anyhow this was somewhat foreseen , which necessitates me protecting myself with a disclaimer.


Just as anything else, improper use of medicine can cause harm, and I'm speaking from the perspective of life wisdom. I wanted a quick fix AKA sleep medicine rather than facing the underlying causes. This caused me even more trouble. My doctor try to warn me but couldn't convince me, so I went to another doctor.

I believe in medicine, I respect the scientific process and from what I have be hearing; many solutions can be implemented before sleep medicine. Rather than phrasing things the way I did in the last comment.... I will say this, I wish that I would have alternatives before I went down the path of medicating for sleep. Like I said , it made things worse.

I'm just trying to prevent someone else from making the same mistakes. But who knows about sleep experts , who knows about CBTI and the success rate, maybe not many people do. I found out after the fact.

Anxiety is bad, its a vicious cycle. I've had it all my life and personally , I believe that sometimes we might be so scared that it may necessitate medicine to rewire ourselves. I believe that this is especially true if the circumstances surrounding our circumstances are unlikely to change.

There might be many people who don't need to take it as far as medication, but there will always be some who do. I'm not incentivized by any gains for sharing this opinions, you never know unless you try, that's what I'm saying.

With that been said, I have to conclude with saying that I'm not a doctor of any sort and this is not medical advice of any kind, neither was the intent for it to be taken as such. The discourse is solely intended to spur on discussion in the hopes for the discovery new ideas and  possibly new approaches. Simply put, I'm not the authority on this topic, these opinions are exactly that... Opinions."
2952,hbtnjuc,,,insomnia,1630945181,"You're right about the inherent contradiction in the stimulus control method, itself one component in a full CBT sleep training system.

If you're using a full CBT program, you'll also learn in-bed relaxation methods you can use to help yourself better induce sleep.

So this is where you make a judgement call.  If you're relaxed with eyes closed but still awake, then you might do better to stay with deep breathing and muscle relaxation.  But if it begins to feel uncomfortable and/or you know you're absolutely too wired or tense to sleep, then absolutely yes that's the time to get up and out of bed and break insomnia's pernicious negative hold.

If you're not using a full CBT sleep training system, you'll probably do better by learning and use all the methods simultaneously.  That's how they work best."

I see a free psychiatrist through a program they have in my state and they didn't hassle me about getting it. I emphasized the anxiety though. 
(Just to add to your options).
I much prefer gaba over benzos."
2962,hbtecac,,,insomnia,1630941184,"If you truly recover then I'd wager your chances of getting insomnia again are still completely unaffected. If you're prone to stress insomnia, then it might start a vicious cycle of stressed so can't sleep &gt; insomnia &gt; stress by insomnia &gt; stressed so can't sleep. In that case, you might develop anxieties to insomnia that linger even once you overcome it. You might feel scared if you can't sleep and this could manifest in another bout of insomnia.

But if you actually ""fix"" your insomnia, then no your chances will not increase. It does depend though.

As to your second question, yeah I guess so. It's a recurring fear among insomniacs that they wasted their opportunity to sleep, and now they regret it. But there have been times I've taken that chance, where I happen to get 3 days of sleep and try to get a 4th one in whilst trying to sleep early. But it didn't work. Sometimes things just don't work out. If failing one day is enough to slip you back into insomnia, you probably didn't recover fully enough.

But even if you do slip back in, it's pretty easy to come back out if you already recovered before. This is because things like sleep hygiene and even exercise or melatonin are enough to get you back to sleep like a kid. For chronic insomniacs, sleep hygiene won't be very effective.

The only way your chances of insomnia increase is if you develop some sort of anxiety to the concept. Or if your insomnia naturally comes in bouts, like seasonal insomnia. Someone might think differnently though"
2963,hbt9dbn,,,insomnia,1630938948,"Thanks for the thorough explanation. I have another question. Let's say suddenly you do get insomnia for the first time in your life, no matter the cause.. If you fix it and can sleep well again, are you going to be more prone to getting insomnia again in the future? Will it be easy to slip back into insomnia from one bad night of staying up too late or something like that? Or does it no matter if you've had it before and it doesn't affect your chance of getting it again?"
2964,hbt8xd0,,,insomnia,1630938739,"There is a holy trinity to resetting sleep schedule, or more intrinsically reinforcing an association to bed with sleep. 1. Sleep restriction, 2. Sleep Hygiene, 3. Getting out of bed if you cannot sleep.

I mean all of which are kind of useless if you can't sleep in the first place, except 3.

A thing people tend to forget is that the association to bed with sleep is strongly mental. Look at children. They doze off like logs, this is because **most** have a very strong sleep association. Kids hate going to bed because they associate it with sleep, so they can't play any more games and have fun.

They view the bed as a tool for sleeping, which is an opposition to their desire to play. But even though they have a somewhat negative connotation to the bed, they still strongly associate it with sleeping.

You can train sleep association in so many different creative ways that I've read on this subreddit. Hell, you can even develop sleep association to TIME ITSELF (idk scientific validity of this). As in, you don't necessarily feel sleepier at certain times but when you look at a time and have the notion that it's very late then your urge and association to and for sleep increases.

I don't recommend reading in the dark. But don't use room lights, use your screenlight with a blue light filter that also reduces your brightness beyond normal minimum range. Over time, I've grown to even associate this blue light filter with sleep.

Sleep associations are more important than managing blue light exposure. Blue light affects melatonin/serotonin levels but can be managed and regulated with high ease, naturally. Sleep associations are harder to forge and reinforce, but very easy as well once you can sleep consistently."

Things i’ve tried thsy haven’t worked include the following: Cutting out caffeine, over the counter sleeping aids, tea like sleepy time, meditation music, podcasts where they tell stories, reading, temperature changes, new locations, going for nightly walks, waking up early every day continuously and going to bed at the same time, fasting, eating foods that promote sleep before bed.

There's other ways besides drugs that might potentially be more effective for you -- particularly cognitive restructuring, one of the core methods in a CBT sleep training system.

What that method does is enable you to counter and reduce those persistent negative sleep thoughts, which helps you to in effect take the pressure off yourself.  That alone can be huge.  By learning to let them go, you start the process of cutting off insomnia's negative fuel and sleep tends to improve.

Use of a CBT sleep training system is the standard of care for primary insomnia.  Something to talk about with your doc."

3025,hbqrqjh,,,insomnia,1630883318,"Your last paragraph makes it clear -- you need another doctor, to be blunt.  Imho.

There's a decent chance the reason none of these drugs worked is because they're not addressing the true underlying causes for your sleep disruption.  Good possibility that's why clonidine won't either.  Only treating the symptom.  

You can try it and see, but if it were me I'd ask for a referral either to another primary care doc or preferably to an MD who specializes in sleep.

Beware treating only the symptom.  There's also at least the possibility your insomnia isn't being caused by anything that's identifiably medical, that's actually most common.  Usually some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about the idea of sleep -- which these drugs by themselves won't treat.

For that the standard of care is use of a substance-free CBT sleep training system.  Ask your doc about that.  Likely do be recommended by a legit sleep doc as well."

Medication is really a last resort but there are people out there who *need* it. Not everyone can skate on through life without medication, it's a sad fact but a fact nonetheless.

3047,hbq7ivk,,,insomnia,1630873785,"Here's a solution to many of your problems. The first is CBTI or cognitive behaviour therapy. This is proven to work for the majority of insomnia sufferers. It requires lifestyle changes but makes a big difference.


The second fix is also very easy, that would be supplements that work. The world around us has changed so rapidly , that we simply did not have time to evolve to live healthy in these conditions. We are lacking in essential nutrients. We are exposed to blue light when we are not supposed to. We consume to much sugar and don't exercise enough. All these things are what we would have been doing naturally. 

Exercise builds up levels of adenosine through out the day which is linked to sleep pressure. Sleep pressure makes it easy falling asleep.

Blue light slows the production of melatonin in the brain which is responsible for letting us know when to feel sleepy. The light from our computer or phones or just bright light at night time. 


L Theanin , magnesium, Apenogin, all of which can be found from plants; can be very helpful.



 Stay away from alcohol and benzodiazepines they are addictive after just 4 weeks of use. They often exacerbate the problem once you quit cold turkey. These drugs are Xanax all the others from the same group. 


It sucks that every time I have a problem I make it worse before learning that there was a simple fix. I'm going to share this information with you. It seems that some of you have problems that can be fix pretty easily. My insomnia could have be fixed had I known these things before I tried medication which makes it worse.

CBTI or cognitive behaviour therapy. Involves a series of things that can be done to relieve insomnia. Meditation also gets me sleepy.

Now on to my case of insomnia.
So I become sleepy but keep involuntary resisting sleep and it is had to overcome the malady. The medications like SSRI and sleeping pills cause this and it is a long story. My condition is unique, I'm trying to overcome a condition response reaction which occurs when I'm half way into subconscious, this what makes it difficult. If there is anyone who has herd of a similar sickness let me know and  remember the natural solutions might save you the trouble I'm in right now.

I'm not a doctor and this is not medical advice. I'm just pointing you to some topics that I believe is worthy of investigation. Don't forget to let me know if you heard of any one who suffer the same type of problem I'm facing."
3048,hbq7dfw,,,insomnia,1630873715,"If you want to go through the process of treating and curing insomnia, then the recommended method is CBT-I (Cognitive behavioral therapy for Insomnia). I recommend finding a Psychiatrist to help you start the program and going from there, but you can look up what is involved easily enough.

Last i recall CBT-I has about an 85% success rate, and even if you fall into the 15% that won't be completely cured, it can improve sleep quality.

Finally Psychiatry will help you deal with the traumatic events that lead to your night time anxiety, which can help you in the long term.

Finally as u/kjiamsietf pointed out melatonin is a hormone, and taking a dosage higher than what your body considers normal can lead to insomnia (usually headaches, migraines, and nightmares), so try reducing your dosage for a few weeks (try 15-20mg if you were using 30 successfully) and see how that effects your sleep."

The past two nights I've cut it down to 12.5mg paired with 25mg of Seroquel and that has mostly done the trick. It just takes me a little longer to fall asleep than the 25/25mg split. Dizziness upon standing is my main complaint and I've been getting random pinprick headaches but they don't last long.

3056,hbpuu3y,,,insomnia,1630868137,"Congratulations on your break through. I thought life was rough until my insomnia went thermonuclear every day I wish I had a broken arm or leg or even cancer, instead of insomnia . I wish my insomnia was just trouble falling and staying asleep like it was a few months ago. I think drugs make it worse. Sleeping pills. My condition is unique, I do feel sleepy but just on the onset of sleep, right before I fall asleep , I have an involuntary response which make me wake up . it is like a panic attack from fear of over sleeping. My fear of over sleeping happens because I happen to feel sleepy with less than 6 hours before its time to go to work and I have overslept before. This happened so many times that it is now a condition response which happens when I'm unconscious which make it difficult to recondition."
3057,hbpqvzq,,,insomnia,1630866360,"I got it for migraines; half a 50mg pill would help me get to sleep but not stay, though I never used it regularly--only as an abortive. Ambien helped me sleep too, probably the best ever, but I'll never take that again because I became addicted very quickly, and it was hard to get off it and back to a place I could sleep without it.

I found mirtazapine better than trazadone for consistent sleep."
3058,hbplgar,,,insomnia,1630863943,"This is great to hear

I sent you a chat message, if you can spare a moment!

3059,hbpg32g,,,insomnia,1630861574,Right? Except for me it didn’t work well for a while. It worked well for like 2 or 3 days
3060,hbpeqk2,,,insomnia,1630860976,thanks for your advice I'm desperately trying to get off ambien because no one prescribes it around here
3061,hbpenu7,,,insomnia,1630860942,Ok I'll give 150 a try then It didn't work last night at 100. I'm trying to get off ambien.
3062,hbped6v,,,insomnia,1630860811,Drinking tons of water and ensuring I get enough stress controlling supplements like magnesium
3063,hbpe68m,,,insomnia,1630860725,"Now that I live in vegas I use a good indica THC edible. I took Ambien for years. I was never a weed guy, but I look forward to laying in bed relaxed as hell each night now"
3064,hbpe4k0,,,insomnia,1630860705,"A rigid sleep schedule is the only thing that ha ever worked for me, but 11 to 7 would be nigh impossible.  I won't allow myself to get out of bed until 5:30, but most nights I wake up anywhere between 2 and 5 and that's it.  Lights out at 11:00."
3065,hbpdg5v,,,insomnia,1630860408,"I dont get doctors who say this. Their argument is that your body naturally makes melatonin. But your body is only making melatonin if you have low enough cortisol levels, and other factors can actually throw off your melatonin production. People who take prozac for instance have been studied and found to have lower levels of melatonin."
3066,hbpcz5z,,,insomnia,1630860201,"Keep in mind that exercise causes you to sweat which means you lose water, sodium, all kinds of electrolytes that you normally wouldn't, all of which are needed for sleep. I would try to up your water intake and try to get at least half your bodyweight in ounces per day. Also try taking magnesium and zinc and any other supplements which may help keep cortisol levels in check.

Good luck."

3068,hbpbfg0,,,insomnia,1630859520,There's also some earplugs online that are cheaper that you mold yourself.
3069,hbpb5ix,,,insomnia,1630859397,"30 mg is way too high and causes blood melatonin levels much higher than what your body normally is able to produce. In other words, assuming your body is having a tough time producing melatonin, you really should be taking 1 mg or less. I take .3 mg to .6 mg and it works fine."
3070,hbpaql9,,,insomnia,1630859211,"Keep in mind that as insomnia continues your stress levels go up too. I have been taking lots of magnesium and trying to limit my caffeine intake, as well as drinking as much water as I can each day and it seems to be helping."
3071,hbpaj9k,,,insomnia,1630859121,"I forgot to mention that today i went to a radiologist to check if my brain was normal or what. I took what it seems to bee mri or xray, not sure. I was told my brain is normal. I will start drinking water more. It might be the case."
3072,hbpa81w,,,insomnia,1630858983,"You're right about being in bed and not sleeping for at least some of the time being normal.  Good sleepers average about 90% sleep efficiency, meaning roughly 45 minutes of an 8 hour sleep duration is spent doing something besides sleep.

Otherwise, you can expect to optimize your waking performance, including creativity, by optimizing your sleep.  The two go hand in hand."
3073,hbp9v7j,,,insomnia,1630858827,"Good chance you've developed a conditioned negative response to the idea of sleep at night in your bed, probably due to many frustrating hours spent tossing and turning.  Those same conditioned cues aren't present during the day.  Actually common with insomniacs.

Fixing your sleep schedule would be a good start.  That means setting and keeping a consistent morning wake time without sleeping in or napping later.  Over the course of several weeks that should reset your body clock.  That then helps ensure you'll get drowsy enough for better sleep at night when you want it."
3074,hbp93j4,,,insomnia,1630858487,"This sounds like the type of insomnia I experience.
I've been having a bad case of it these past 4 day but last night I think I managed to find a way to get some sleep 

 I just tried a deep breathing exercise where you slowly inhale and slowly exhale with each exhale being counted.
Do it until you get to the count of 10 or when you feel very relaxed. I hope this helps!"

3078,hbp576f,,,insomnia,1630856780,"Unsure from just this info.  Sounds like you're at least attempting to work a sleep supportive plan.  

If the headaches continue, suggest you see a doc to ensure no med issues.  It could be something like seasonal allergies.  Short term you might try a little more water an hour or two before bedtime in case it's simple dehydration."
3079,hbp4tcz,,,insomnia,1630856609,"Haven't heard this.  Unless there's shown to be some beneficial effect on circadian metabolic functions or neurotransmitters involved with sleep, I see no reason to believe it's more of a factor than any other diet."

3090,hbotwvx,,,insomnia,1630851713,I took 5mg melatonin as needed.  Now it did not work for me any more.  30mg is too high.  Someone said .3 - .5mg is good enough.
3091,hboq332,,,insomnia,1630849880,"I would add try a sleep mask, I have had some recent success with it.  I find it forces my eye and face muscles to relax which helps me to relax/sleep after a day of looking at screens. I prefer a mask made out of satin, it's not as hot as other materials."
3092,hboowuk,,,insomnia,1630849287,Although there is no debating your body temp is at its lowest during REM
3093,hbootn2,,,insomnia,1630849238,"Yeah so I used to do the same.

And I’m not saying you’re wrong, at all. But what I read and was later told was that the warmth is relaxing and soothing, and while the heat can in theory make you wakeful, the heat “leaving” you (that feeling when you get into cold sheets in a room with a fan on after being warm) is what makes you sleepy. 

I think we are actually arguing the same thing thru different methods.

Glad you found something that worked!"
3094,hboo2u1,,,insomnia,1630848840,"30mg is a lot IMO. I only take 3mg and even that they say is high.

It’s a natural hormone but taking it nightly in 30mg would probably destroy your natural melatonin."
3095,hbonfv7,,,insomnia,1630848493,"on contrary, my sleep doctor asked me to have a hot bath every single night so I have done this as part of my routine every 8PM.

3099,hbol06o,,,insomnia,1630847137,"For me, I gained a tolerance suuuuuper fast. I was prescribed 1 50mg tablet before bed. The first 2 nights were great. Out like a light and in a deep sleep. The third night didn’t work so well so the fourth night I took 100mg and it was lights out again for the next 2 nights. Then, 100mg wasn’t working as well as it did. It’s probably just me but my tolerance for it shot up super quick. Like I said it was GREAT for two nights then I had to double my dose."
3100,hboimfp,,,insomnia,1630845716,"I would try CBT-I before sleeping pills, but since your a college student and that’s a lot of stress, a prescription may be beneficial for you.

3101,hboh1by,,,insomnia,1630844690,"Handful of trail-mix, glass of almond milk and a banana or Greek yogurt. I would those recommend foods because they are high in magnesium and tryptophan, which aid in melatonin production"

I’ve had success with trazodone, but it’s not for me long term. I can’t stop eating. Sounds funny until it isn’t lol. It has been so so with consistent sleep. When it works, it knocks me out and there’s a hangover. When it doesn’t, I’m in and out of sleep all night. Of course all that is better than NO sleep which is what I was getting.

Good luck. You’re on the right track.

Have you tried cold showers before bed? Your body temp is at its lowest in REM sleep and you can trick your body into deep sleep by taking a cold shower before bed. It’s counter intuitive. Just a quick hack that sometimes helps me. There really is science to it."

3117,hbnltoc,,,insomnia,1630819116,"It’s slowly been building itself up for past month I’d say honesty it’s been past week and a half tho where it’s just to the point where I let myself overthink and fear being asleep while in bed. Can’t think of a certain event that triggered it it’s really just been a slow build up over a month. When I’m trying to sleep I begin to fear being unconscious and the whole process of me forgetting the last few minutes of us being awake like usual, as the days pass I always vividly think about my last moments awake the night before and what it felt like. I don’t get nightmares or bad sleep but the whole Process of being unconscious and just the haziness of reality perception surrounding that makes me anxious and scared to sleep. It’s definitely an irrational fear because I used to seek comfort in sleeping like many people do. I feel like the reasons are just my overthinking and me over analyzing the whole Process of sleep."

3119,hbnk2b2,,,insomnia,1630817877,"I had great success with CBT-Insomnia through a therapist. 

Is my sleep 100% better? No. But in the months leading up to seeing the therapist I was getting about 2 hours a night total sleep and was losing my shit.

It started with a kind of sleep deprivation. If I was getting 6 x 30 min blocks of sleep a night, my first week I had to go to bed at 3am and wake up at 6am. Wasn’t allowed in my bed outside those hours. Week two, we moved bedtime to 2:30am and so on.

This plus keeping a rigorous sleep diary (when I woke up, how many times, how long was I in bed trying to sleep), plus behavioral changes (if I can’t sleep within about 15 mins, get back up and sit quietly in another room for example) made a big difference. 

I wouldn’t attempt all of this without support. Having a professional monitor my progress was important. But I can’t stress enough how much this improved my situation. I probably get 6 hours most nights now."

I used to always get in bed about 1-2 hours before when I wanted to sleep, and use that time to relax and wind down by watching a tv show on my laptop (with blue light blocking program). That always worked for me before. Is it really that bad to do that? Because my issue is that lying down and watching something is the only way I feel really relaxed and comfortable. Watching something while sitting up in a chair just doesn't hit the spot. After sitting in a computer chair all day, I really want to lie down and enjoy myself before sleeping. As long as I'm not trying to pressure myself to sleep and I'm not getting frustrated by not being able to fall asleep,  will my brain really link my bed with wakefulness?"

3161,hbm46ql,,,insomnia,1630790309,"I wonder if this is what I have. My insomnia started after my father died in 2013, my biggest mistake was going to see him after he passed. I was terrified, still am at times of going to sleep and not waking up. My father died while being under due to a blood clot during surgery. He never even knew he was dying. That stuck with me to this day and terrifies me to no end. I am overly fearful of my own mortality. 

I am sorry you're going through this. I am still struggling to sleep almost 8 years later so I don't know what to tell you but I hope you get past it some how."

3167,hblyjw1,,,insomnia,1630787741,"Anxiety/Phobias/Panic attacks suck. I know, because I'm also dealing with it. However, it's up to us to research it and get help and overcome it. Only we can overcome our fears. No one can do it for us. There's no shortcuts and magical easy way out that most people are searching for. I recommend reading some books about cognitive behavior therapy. It helps us change our thoughts from negative ones to positive ones. We also have to accept that we have those fears, and while they may be be uncomfortable, they are not dangerous. We have to face our fears and tackle the problem head on, our else it will only get worse and worse, as you already said, it's ruining your life. If you really want help, then you must find it within yourself to learn how to overcome your issues, and then put in the work to implement what you've learned. The learning part is easy, that's what books and therapy is for. Implementing it however, that will be up to you and your own will power. It will be hard at first, but you have to ask yourself, is short term discomfort worth the long term gain of having a normal life again? I think it's a big YES.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any phobias, but I have been dealing with GAD/Panic attacks/Insomnia. These are a few books that I've read recently that have helped me:

3172,hblqdts,,,insomnia,1630784033,"I think that the first step to try to learn to fall asleep is to have a ritual. The goal is to make understand your brain that your bed = sleep.

So for exemple, if you have insomnia, you need to get out of your bed so your brain doesn't associate your bed with insomnia and wake up time. Try to do something calm, peaceful. Try to avoid any screen. And retry after a while to fall asleep.

Before the time when you want to sleep, it's better if you can avoid any screen for 1-2 hours, it's exciting for the brain. You can try infusions too. Another general recommandation known atm is to practice some sport. Try to not stress yourself about your sleep (it's hard unfortunatly).

You could talk about it with your doctor or another professional to have the best recommendations and specifics advises about your health and situation."

Whilst weed may help you fall asleep, it doesn't actually mean that you're getting more ""restorative"" sleep.  Same with alcohol - they both interrupt your normal sleep cycles.

There's also the risk of rebound insomnia once you stop smoking weed."

How do I use that to my advantage though, if I can't get good sleep until around 8am? It seems like I'm stuck in this sleep cycle of getting only a couple hours of sleep at night as if that's what I somehow trained myself to do. 

Do you have any recommendations on good sleep training systems? I read a book a few days ago called say good night to insomnia, but I've yet to actually implement the strict protocols."

Personally I started on 15 mg mirtazapine (remeron) and realized that I didn't need that much to knock me out, and the side effects like overeating were eliminated by taking less.

3188,hbl3n6t,,,insomnia,1630773844,"The reason these substances aren't working likely is because they're not treating the underlying basis for the sleep disruption.  That's what you need to ID and address.

Start with your doc.  If no med conditions, it's usually some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  Pills and booze won't fix that.  Use of a CBT sleep training system is the standard of care.

Gotta say alcohol for sleep is one of the very worse things you can do.  Although initially a sedative, as it wears off in a few hours we experience a stimulating rebound which worsens sleep the rest of the night.  Like drinking seawater when you're thirsty."
3189,hbl3c1g,,,insomnia,1630773706,"These are really good questions and you're right to pursue the substance- free CBT sleep training methods you're describing.  They will help.

Yawning is actually one good sign you're ready for sleep.  So is a bit of a chill feeling, as body temps tend to drop before and during sleep.  Head nodding, mind-wandering are also cues to be aware of.

Consistency with sleep scheduling is also important, but more important than bed time is wake time, as that's what regulates your body clock.

Yes a quiet dark cool bedroom is optimal.

Don't allow yourself to toss and turn for hours at a time.  The 20 minute standard is somewhat arbitrary, but yes get out of bed if you know you're absolutely too wired to sleep.

You'll get best results if you follow a full CBT sleep training system very closely, as those programs will give you a complete roadmap and instructions."
3190,hbl2n5k,,,insomnia,1630773403,"Given your ADHD diagnosis, this is best discussed with your doc/therapist.

At your age some level of body clock disruption is normal.  One way to counter that is to keep a very consistent wake time every morning best you can, without sleeping in or napping later.  That helps ensure you'll be drowsy enough for sleep at a more reasonable time the following night.

Try to really tire yourself out every day best you can, and that usually includes some good physical exercise."
3191,hbl2bzc,,,insomnia,1630773268,"Given your depression you should talk to your doc/therapist.  Short term, there's a number of things you can try.

One key is to avoid or at least minimize any napping, which can in effect steal sleep from the following night.  Avoid sleeping in for the same reason.  Keeping a disciplined wake time is important, as is some good physical exercise most every day to help really tire yourself out.

You might also benefit from planning a good hour or so wind down before bed, screen free and as stress free as you can make it, to just relax and better transition to a restful state.

Use of a CBT sleep training system will give you many more substance free methods."
3192,hbl1t7r,,,insomnia,1630773040,"CBT sleep training methods, sometimes abbreviated CBT-I, are a collection of substance free techniques to improve sleep.  They typically include stress management, cognitive restructuring, stimulus control, and sleep hygiene, among others.  This is the standard of care for treating insomnia.

ACT is more specifically a cognitive method to both become aware of negative, stressful thoughts and to learn better how to release them.  It is a form of cognitive restructuring, and also considered very helpful for sleep, though it is not per se a behavioral method.

You can learn these methods either from a counselor/therapist, or from written sources.   
 Whether or not you're better suited for one or the other depends on if you're the self-help type or not."

Taking some Benadryl helped me fall asleep sometimes, but didn't make me sleep for a very long time, &amp; it didn't work if I took it every day - tolerance build up? Idk. It wasn't that helpful for me but you could try. 

Marijuana was somewhat helpful to me, legal where I'm at. I used Indica strains in vape form &amp; edible gummy form. That helped me a lot more than the Benadryl. 

My doctor just prescribed my Ambien. It's 5mg but I cut it in half. I've been taking it every day for the past week to get my sleep schedule back on track &amp; then I'm supposed to try not using it &amp; only use it when I really need it. But that definitely helps lol unfortunately that's not a long term solution though as it can be addictive &amp; most doctors will not continue to prescribe it &amp; it can be difficult to get a prescription for in the first place. But if you're really really struggling, I highly suggest asking your doctor about it just to get you back into a normal sleep rhythm. My doctor is hoping after taking it for a week &amp; getting back into a normal sleep rhythm that it will kind of ""reset"" my body &amp; ill be able to sleep a little better &amp; not have to rely on it very much.

Good luck!

Edit: I also got a fitbit sense to track my sleep so I could show my doctor. It tracks how long you slept, how deep of a sleep (like how long you got REM sleep per night, etc) &amp; whatnot. The Sense was a bit pricey at $199 but there are cheaper options. There is also a $9.99 monthly subscription. Not sure if you're interested in that, but I like it."

How long have you had it for? Did a certain event trigger it or make it worse? Can you describe the fear? For example, I know phobias are called irrational fears but when you're scared of spiders you can pinpoint reasons why like their legs, their unpredictable speed, creepiness, etc. Can you pinpoint any reasons for somnophobia?

Do you have bad nightmares? Is this a recurring bout of insomnia that happens every now and then, or are you scared of sleep to this extent every day?"

CBT is based on challenging any negative/maladaptive thoughts/behaviour and in doing so changing them. Basically retraining mind.

ACT is more about not engaging with the negative/maladaptive thoughts but rather accepting they exist without judgement and continuing on in spite of them to fulfill your values/goals.

3211,hbkggeh,,,insomnia,1630763208,Following this
3212,hbkerf0,,,insomnia,1630762328,Taking it before sleeping. I think we upped the dosage because I was experiencing crippling anxiety. There are so many things wrong with me and my life it’s been a game of whack a mole.
3213,hbkel6m,,,insomnia,1630762234,"Valium only works for me if I take one hour before bedtime, unlike ambien that knocks me out. But if people start taking one pill a day it may cause dependence.  

Valium, unlike other benzos, is not carcinogenic. For me it’s perfect."
3214,hbke684,,,insomnia,1630762009,"Trazodone, Diazepam, and weed works for me. I also started jogging for half an hour everyday and sleeping only 6 hours a day — going to sleep everyday at the same time. I go to bed at 11:30 and wakeup always at 6:00.

Be careful with Ambien, it’ll raise your probability of developing any cancer by about 50%. Try to avoid it, when I really can’t sleep I take 5mg."
3215,hbke1cq,,,insomnia,1630761937,"Cool, thanks for the heads up. It was the same or maybe I felt less brain fog throughout the day while on Strattera. 

I definitely wouldn’t recommend stimulants from personal history. They can negatively alter your mood without you being able to tell subjectively. I got to the point where I was crying on the roof thinking of jumping off for no reason when I stopped taking them. Realized after that, that I was medically depressed for years and just couldn’t tell. 

They work for some people though, so best to have someone you trust monitor you and see what happens. 

I tried melatonin years ago but will try it again. It didn’t work previously but chemistry changes as we age or so I think."
3216,hbkdcq2,,,insomnia,1630761585,"Are you taking it in the morning or before sleeping? My doctor explained to me that a normal/ high dose is used to treat depression, and it's usually taken in the morning. 
A smaller dose is used for insomnia,  and it's usually taken before going to bed."
3217,hbkd272,,,insomnia,1630761423,"It's strange that you are on the maximum dose, my psychiatrist had me on a small dosage because according to him higher doses actually make you more active, instead of sedating you.

I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to suggest you to try another dosage, but maybe ask your doctor if you could try to reduce the dosage. 
If you take it just for the insomnia, of course, if you're taking it to treat depression or other things it makes sense to take a higher dose."
3218,hbkcao5,,,insomnia,1630760996,"I've been on Strattera for a little more than three months and it has destroyed my sleep, with little benefits to my sleep.
Did you sleep well before taking it?

I've an appointment with my psychiatrist on the 7th, and I'm definitely going to try something else. I'm scared because apparently stimulants are even worse than Stattera for sleep, but I'm willing to give them a try.
 
I took mirtazapine for a few weeks, but it made me really hungry. I prefer hunger to this zombie like feeling, so maybe I will ask for it again. You can't take it as needed though, from what my doctor told me.

I don't have any advice sadly, I'm in the same boat as you.

For the record, many people enjoy Strattera, so it's a me problem, and I'm not saying that the medication is not good. I guess it's a personal thing.

Edit: my doctor advised me to take melatonin 2 hours before going to bed, which surprised me because I thought melatonin was supposed to be taken while you were already in bed. For me it definitely works better 2 hours before, so you might give it a try!"

I learned some amazing tools with CBT and counseling and perhaps that also helped with the head rushes. 

A week before the head rushes and jerks started my sleep started to get broken. I was wakenjng ever 2-3 hours. Then one night I was trying to sleep and when I closed my eyes these sensation with jerks happened. Then they happened more and more. At the worst I did not sleep for 3 days straight. 

I was a wreck. The more they happened the more anxiety and stress I had which lowly contributed to it. 

Be diligent with your doctor. Ask for complete blood work. Get referred to CBT to deal with anxiety and tools to manage it. 

I’m also on Lexapro now to aid with my anxiety. 

I have not had those zaps/jerks for 6 months now. 

They likely are not anything from any significant health issue. I hope that is somewhat easing any anxiety around them.

I've been worried to death about having a serious neurological problem and being in risk of a stroke or something, and the sleep issues just makes everything worse.

I can't wait for this upcoming appointment and to get tests. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel normal again."
3240,hbjf6a5,,,insomnia,1630734785,"Absolutely. Those head rushes are what prompted me to seek the ER 3 separate times. I had numerous standard blood tests, heart monitors as well as a CT Scan. All normal. 

I thought I was dying or going crazy. 

Every time I closed my eyes to sleep I would get them and it would keep me up. It felt like a wave of energy behind my eyes and down to my chest. Often followed by bad hypnic jerks. 

It wasn’t until a pushed for more testing I was seen by a medical internist. 

I had urine and complete blood test. Everything normal but quite b12 deficient. 

I can offer comfort in that they went away completely after having them every night for hours on end for 4 months."

3242,hbje79k,,,insomnia,1630734081,"I had exactly this after a few months of spiralling anxiety due to health symptoms that were going undiagnosed and becoming panicked. 

I took CBT and in person counseling and was then finally diagnosed with b12 deficiency. 

After starting supplementation and using the CBT tools it began to calm down. 

I now no longer suffer from them. 

I don’t know if it was all anxiety or if the deficiency caused this or both."

3274,hbils98,,,insomnia,1630717690,"Been dealing a this for years. Right now I’m taking Ambien CR (Zolpidem), melatonin, and a lot of weed. My issue is related to anxiety so the ambien really helps me fall asleep. Once the Ambien hits I can finally take a deep breath and forget about falling asleep. 


HOWEVER, even with the time extended release formulation, I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep. So I usually only get 5hrs when I take the combo. Ambien also causes dependency and I’m unable to sleep once I take it for a few days in a row. Thus, I have to taper down the dose before I can take a break from it. 

Still looking for a more sustainable pharmacological solution."
3275,hbil7r6,,,insomnia,1630717397,Close your eyes when you’re trying to fall asleep and practice deep breathing focusing on pushing out your stomach as you inhale and hold the breaths. This will relax your nervous system and usually helps me to fall asleep

And that's going to screw with your sleep along with the anxiety.  Depression and anxiety especially hurt with maintenance insomnia and early awakening/fragmented sleep.  You really need to attack the depression and anxiety to ultimately cure this.  Consolidating your sleep should help also, maybe spending 6-7 hrs in bed to see if that works."

I WILL tell you this, Ive spent the last few months with much poorer sleep and I work a pretty physical job pouring concrete patios, often by hand no truck.  If anything im just getting leaner, not really losing muscle mass.  But I eat a lot of protein, get my 3 cups of veggies (from a v8) and make sure im not exacerbating any fatigue from lack of sleep by getting daily required potassium.

This is very interesting but the study only measured grip strength? not muscle mass? And no I am not dieting, in fact I read somewhere that consuming additional amounts of protein can kind of compensate for the lack of sleep, so that is what I am doing."
3291,hbhzqzj,,,insomnia,1630706707,"The only actual real study I found on university aged students DID indicate a correlation  between muscle strength and mass in both directions more sleep, better recovery.  And that was measuring poor sleep vs 8 hours a night over the course of a month.  Weirdly normal sleep quality in the study allowed for a full week a month of poor sleep.  The difference after a month in the lowest sleep quality compared to higher sleep quality group lost about 1% of grip strength over the course of the month. Females lost an even more negligible amount.  The sleep was self reported so is subject to recall bias.  2017 study.

I wouldn't trust editorial or fitness sites because usually their ""medical adviser/dietitian/specialist"" is just another editor that works for the site lol.  Too much bias, even if they are qualified."

3307,hbhfdp6,,,insomnia,1630697485,"I sure wish I remembered what they gave me in the ER, I can't find it in my medical records either. I will say, I was only given it once so, I assume it's probably a pretty strong drug probably only used in severe circumstances. 

Ongoing prescriptions that I got put on after the ER visit are: sertraline, gabapentin, quetiapine fumarate. I had been on trazadone for a very short time years ago, it worked a couple of times and then stopped working. I also got put on zyprexa when they thought I might be bipolar and that also helped me sleep... for awhile. 

Even all of the drugs I'm still on initially helped me sleep then stopped. I went back to using marijuana edibles in conjunction with the prescriptions. Prior to going into the ER, I was taking marijuana edibles, melatonin, and sleeping pills, together, trying to go to sleep. My doctors, universally, thought marijuana was a bad idea for me and, for about a month or two out of the ER, I didn't use any trying to listen to their advice. When those prescription drugs started failing me, again, I went back to using it and between that and the prescriptions - I can fall asleep and stay asleep! I've been honest with my doctors too and, they're not thrilled about it but, I also haven't ended up back in the ER so, there's that! I haven't slept as well as I have been lately consistently, in years! It has been so nice! I sure hope it keeps working!"

Last night I was able to get a great nights sleep, and I think a big part of it was listening to a ""Sleep Story"" on the Headspace app. I woke up in the middle of the night, replayed the story, and was surprised how much of the story I didn't hear the first time because I just passed out.

3314,hbh7tlf,,,insomnia,1630694174,"I'm on 25 mg of quetiapine. It's the only thing that gets me to sleep without having to up the dose. I've been on 25 mg for 9 years or so. There's been times that I took 50 mg when the stress is so bad nothing makes me sleep but it's easy to get back to 25 when the stress settles a bit.  The downside is that it will have the common side effects for awhile as it takes time for those to go away as it's an anti psychotic (often used to treat insomnia).

Feeling groggy in the morning and a bit zombie like are unavoidable with meds like that, but the effects do go away in time. I haven't felt that after a few months and the fog usually cleared up fast upon waking anyway. 

The actual downside to quetiapine is that your brain sort of forgets how to sleep without it. My partner asked for half a dose once as he couldn't sleep night after night. He slept lovely on those 12,5 mg. But he couldn't sleep for the next 3 days and described it as his brain forgetting how to sleep. Now I don't sleep at all so no problem for me, but I understand that's annoying for people that do have some ability to sleep.

Now it's take the dose, wait 2 hours, go to bed and do routine, sleep sort of and wake up after 5 hours-ish (not counting external disturbance factors lol). It's decent enough to get through the day and jump into my workout at 6 AM. 

Not ideal and not what you've asked for but I like the stuff, so just mentioning it."
3315,hbh50fk,,,insomnia,1630692949,"I have found that I get exercise induced insomnia if I do multiple weightlifting sets to failure. Just one set and I'm fine. And if I stay a few reps short of failure I usually do ok with multiple sets. Unless I just do way too many sets. Also you have to ease back onto working out. You can gradually increase the intensity/volume over a few weeks. You can't just immediately go all out.

For aerobic stuff if you run yourself to collapsing, again you might have insomnia. It if you suddenly go way longer than normal. 

On top of all this just being really onto exercise can make insomnia more likely so you have to make extra sure you're eat nutrient rich foods. Plenty of potassium, magnesium. Plenty of antioxidants. Make sure your b12 level is above 600. Make sure your vitamin d is good."
3316,hbh3xfz,,,insomnia,1630692480,"Melatonin helps and it’s over the counter I never had any side effects and it’s not addictive, but you can develop a tolerance.

3317,hbh2yy6,,,insomnia,1630692071,"It's a good idea to discuss with your psychiatrist and consider what kind of therapy you're best suited for.  That may or may not be drugs or substances like you've been using.

Not surprising your sleep issues are connected to the increased stress/anxiety around school, that's understandable.  But one takeaway is the substances you've been using so far haven't worked because they're not addressing the underlying issues.  Identifying and addressing those underlying issues are keys to improving sleep.

You likely have at least some overlap with nonmed issues, including some bad sleep habits.  For instance allowing up to 12 hours in bed is excessive.  You probably should also be using wake time instead of bedtime as a zeitgeber to regulate your body clock.

Your therapist may suggest using a CBT sleep training system in conjunction with whatever other therapy you're getting.  Those methods will help you correct and improve your sleep habits and lifestyle, while providing techniques to better manage stress and anxiety.  Completely substance free I might add."
3318,hbh25ox,,,insomnia,1630691726,"My sleep is pretty-much what you describe. The only thing that has worked for me is zopiclone. I take it about 50% of the time. No issue with dependence or tolerance yet, and it's been several years.

However, everyone reacts differently. If you find that Ambien stops working if you take it more than once every 4 days, then that's pretty quick tolerance. BTW, have you tried it for a week or two in a row? You really shouldn't develop a tolerance to it that quickly. It normally takes over a month to develop tolerance in most people.

In any case, it sounds like you can take it 25% of the time without developing a tolerance. (Once every 4 days.) At least that's something. Personally, I can go 2 or 3 nights of very little sleep, and still function okay. One good sleep every 4 nights might be enough. Certainly better than none.

You've tried all the non-med treatments, so you may just be stuck with Ambien (or another z-drug), taken 25% of the time. I do recommend trying other z-drugs, to see if they're any better for you."
3319,hbh0fhl,,,insomnia,1630690994,Zopiclone never fails me ☺️
3320,hbh0asq,,,insomnia,1630690940,"Yeah, Ambien should let you sleep. Just make sure to go to bed within about 30 minutes after taking it, and just prepare to sleep. If you don't go to bed, it doesn't really work too well. You likely won't notice anything, other than just going to sleep like a normie.

If you still wake up, you could try a longer-acting z-drug, such as zopiclone, or ambien extended release. Or, perhaps just take half when you go to bed, and the other half a few hours later if you wake up.

I find zopiclone gives me a good 5 hours sleep, sometimes 6. Then, if I'm lucky, a couple more hours on and off until morning. So, probably double (or more) what I would get without it, when my insomnia kicks in."

I mention this option because I've been thinking about doing telehealth myself, and have been researching it lately. It seems legit.

It's possible also that you're experiencing some significant sleep state misperception in the second half of the night, meaning you're actually sleeping a lot more than you think you are, but either aren't aware of it or discount it as if it doesn't count.  Also very common.

If you keep a written sleep log you might be surprised you're getting much more sleep than you think you are, that happens a lot to those who stress about sleep.

It sounds like you might need some real medication, at least for a short time until you reset your sleep schedule. A z-drug might work well. If you don't want to use a sedative like a z-drug, then try Benadryl.

Waking up after 3-4 hours and being unable to sleep is pretty typical of sleep maintenance insomnia."

If it's an intense workout, your cortisol levels will be higher and need more time to come down in the evening - and in fact if you're going from couch potato to even a regular workout, it will also yield that higher stress response. You could try limiting your total workout time or the intensity in the evening. Apparently an hour is usually enough anyway, testosterone levels start to drop after. 

You could try implementing a wind-down routine at night to thoroughly relax as well."

If you want to be in bed at 8 pm, you'd be starting your day at 4 am; I expect this isn't what you want. The key is to get up at a consistent time in the morning.

The only way to shift your circadian rhythm back is to get up in the morning at a consistent time. Don't go to bed ""early"" right away, you won't have enough sleep pressure; this means in the interim you'll have less total time in bed for a couple of days. Subsequently, limit your total time in bed to 8h. It really helps to get exposure to bright light from the sun when you get up in the morning and throughout the day, you'll shift faster that way.

I had no other choice,I had to pee in the sink because if I peed in the toilet,then my parents would notice it easily and could scold me for it,thats why I urinate in sink.

Only advice I can give is to maintain good sleep hygiene. Have a ritual before going to bed to tell your brain you’re entering “go to sleep” mode. At the moment it seems like this habit is going on your phone which, even with adjusted brightness settings, can be a hindrance.

3388,hbfe9ax,,,insomnia,1630662105,"I am reading a quite interesting book called ""The Sleep Solution"". I am at the beginning, so I can't review it yet. But it stuck with me how - with humor - he says that doctors dislike people who claim not to have slept for 5 nights. You might sleep a little, experience bad sleep or both. But... it's \*incredibly\* rare not to sleep for 5 nights, and you would not be functional (eg. able to write on Reddit). Of course I do not condone doctors not being empathic towards their patients (or people in general), but being realistic might be the best strategy to get help. 

I understand your pain, but I would take an appointment with your primary care doctor, unless of course you are experience secondary effects such as suicidal ideations or hallucinations. Is there any sleep clinics around you? Or sleep doctors? 

Where I live there are - in the biggest cities - ER reserved just for psychiatric problems. Since there is still COVID, to get help/med that might be a good road, instead of going to the normal ER, even you do not suspect you are having psychiatric issues. Many psychiatrist are used to help with insomnia.

Good luck to you, I hope you'll be able to get some rest soon."

I looked him dead in the face and said “You think I’d come crawling in at 3 AM unable to deal with my pain because I need Sudafed?!”

Was prescribed actual medication, cleared up in a few days. Don’t let one bad experience cloud everything, I know it’s really hard and I have absolutely done the same. It’s really hard to be your own advocate especially in the throws of mania. It’s so very hard but we have to advocate for ourselves so they pay attention, that is their whole job. Don’t like the ER DR? Ask for a new one! It’s your health, it’s your neck, and end of the day it’s not theirs. I have a few stories such as my mother having to be her own advocate to have her ovarian cancer found out! It’s wild. But we have to do it, we have to speak up, we have to fight for ourselves.

It’s a case for getting help as soon as you can, meaning ER. If you had a broken arm for five days would you not seek help?

Basically depression and insomnia feed each other (you’re depressed because you’re an insomniac, and you’re an insomniac because you’re depressed),so you need to treat both diseases at the same time to improve.

You can’t think your way to falling back asleep. Focus on your body. 

Youtube “yoga nidra.” Click the first one. Do it during the day as practice. Then consider doing it when you wake up in the middle of the night. You can either listen to it, or just do it in your head roughly from memory, that way you don’t have to mess with your phone at night.

Then try your best to look at ways to improve sleep, exercise,  avoid using your mobile before you sleep, reading a good book, writing a few notes of worries, to do lists. Another thing is if you are tossing and turning, do not stay there, get up and walk into another room and do something till you are tired. But if it’s like 4am and you gotta be up early anyway, then stay up and stick on the telly. 
But also think of what you can do in your household that wouldn’t wake anyone up, you are hardly gonna put the hoover on the floor at midnight or 4am. So think about folding up Landry or reading a newspaper, book, articles on your phone or scrolling on reddit/Facebook."

Have you ever thought of trying to come off Xanax?  Or to you feel pretty stable at that dose?"
3459,hbdg99i,,,insomnia,1630621375,"A couple of things might be going on here.

One is a conditioned negative response to the idea of sleep at night, likely caused by so many frustrating hours spent trying to sleep and instead just tossing and turning.  Many can relate.  That same conditioning isn't present during the day, making sleep at that time less stressful.

A second factor is likely your body clock, which has now gotten used to being awake at night and asleep during the day. 

You may be able to reset your body clock by establishing a very consistent wake time in the morning without sleeping in or napping later.  The first few days might be tough, but if you get through that you'll begin to reset your body clock on a more normal pattern.  And you'll begin to feel drowsy enough to get some sleep at night.

You'll still need to undo that negative conditioning, and there are ways to to do that, especially if you use a CBT sleep training system.  But start with wake time and see how you do."

3462,hbdfih9,,,insomnia,1630621044,"This is of course a personal decision, but there's some underlying premises here that are questionable to say the least.

First is the idea that anyone really goes 5 nights with ""no sleep"".  Clinical sleep studies show even the very worst insomniacs typically experience very rapid sleep onset if given the opportunity to sleep after only 24 hours of nonstop wakefulness.  It is a mistake to think sleep is anything less than a very elemental, overpowering force that at some point becomes irresistible for us all.

That said, the same overwhelming desire for sleep can become literally maddening for some insomniacs, who will sometimes go to great lengths to get some relief even if means unnaturally forcing sleep, or worse, anesthetizing themselves.   But that's going about it wrong and can have deadly results.  Just ask Michael Jackson.

The better approach is to start with your doc to either treat or rule out an underlying med condition.  If none, which is most common, then you're likely doing it to yourself with some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  Very common.

For that the standard of care is use of a CBT sleep training system, which is substance free and a permanent solution for most.  Those methods enable you to take the pressure off yourself, which can do wonders, while establishing a much healthier sleep supportive lifestyle."

The lack of sleep for years has caused me serious weight gain, yet no real appetite, severe pain, jaw pain migraines and complete isolation.

Many posters here have tried countless herbs and supplements to no avail and speak from experience.  There's usually better ways, starting with your doc to try and identify what underlying conditions are causing the sleep disruption.

Most insomniacs have no identifiable medical conditions disrupting sleep, which is so often the reason why substances and drugs don't work long term.  It's usually some nonmedical combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  For that, the standard of care is use of a CBT sleep training system, which is substance free."

I'll detail, like I have for others, what worked for me; I appeal to you to try it, its not a magic bullet, it takes effort, but it will work.

1) Trazodone, we need help going to sleep - that's obvious"
3518,hbc0ps0,,,insomnia,1630600204,Seroquel and trazadone work for me. 12.5 mg of each
3519,hbc0g41,,,insomnia,1630600099,"All of your vitamins were checked? In my last blood test, only B12 and D were checked and D was very low. Now I'm taking a supplement."
3520,hbc0f8e,,,insomnia,1630600090,I wouldn't recommend this. I'd talk to a doctor and follow the doctor's advice.
3521,hbc03rj,,,insomnia,1630599966,"1mg melatonin 1 hour before bed, take another 1mg melatonin 30 minutes before bed, and then take valerian root at bed time."

3523,hbbxw3y,,,insomnia,1630599089,What kind of underlying medical issues would it be?
3524,hbbxrk2,,,insomnia,1630599038,"Tough situation.  Be sure to talk to your prescribing doc as an adjustment in meds might help a lot.

Short term, you can use various CBT sleep training methods which are substance free, such as in-bed relaxation techniques and a sleep supportive lifestyle."
3525,hbbxjv1,,,insomnia,1630598953,"Hard to say what might be going on from just this.  If you still ""don't get tired"" that suggests at least the possibility that you are sleeping a lot more than you think you are.  Sleep state misperception is very common.

Otherwise sounds like your lifestyle is conducive to good sleep.  For a complete solution start with a checkup to ensure no untreated med issues.  After that using a full CBT sleep training system will give you a comprehensive and permanent solution."
3526,hbbx5zl,,,insomnia,1630598799,"Good chance that stress about sleep is fueling this to at least some extent.  Potent underlying cause for so much insomnia.

Since this has been going on for so long, you'd be well advised to talk to your doc to at least ensure no untreated med issues causing this.  If none, then use of a CBT sleep training system will give you a substance free solution for the usual nonmed root issues, including excessive stress about sleep."

3529,hbbvhmc,,,insomnia,1630598135,"Go to your doctor, try to get into a sleep clinic. Have you tried herbal things like valerian root capsules, passionflower and skullcap? There is a nice tea (yogi tea brand I think) that makes a few good ones like kava kava tea, bed time and like lavender something. I literally mix the 3 into 1 cup and pound it back. Zzzquil or just nyquil in a pinch. I know they say to ""unplug"" and no devices in the room at night but try guided meditation with rain or thunder in the background. Shit, my go to is horror narrators. Good luck dude!"
3530,hbbscx3,,,insomnia,1630596836,"I hear you, I was really bad when mine started 7 years ago.  To the point I was having nervous break downs.

7 years later I still have insomnia but I’ve definitely learned how to deal with it better.

In the beginning I was willing to swallow any pill plus alcohol to get a few hours of sleep.  Well that was not the best off ideas and luckily I didn’t die.

Took me some time to come off the benzos and anti depressant.  But not I take a partial dose of ambien and partial dose of seroquel and I sleep decent.  I’d say on average 5-7 hours now.

That combo has really helped me and I have been staying at this dose for at least the last 3 years now maybe 4 now."

3541,hbbip0d,,,insomnia,1630592796,I just came back from an Ayahuasca retreat and have slept five nights in a row with no medication. I am 57 years old and have had sleep problems my entire life. When I was under the effects of Aya I watched these beings repairing and “upgrading” me to a better version. I am beyond astounded that I have been able to fall asleep naturally AND stay asleep. So grateful for Mother Ayahuasca!
3542,hbbgwtf,,,insomnia,1630592043,"I just went a month without sleeping.. 2 nights in the past month I slept 3-5 hours. I just had four nights of not sleeping straight. Nothing worked. I tried Unisom, melatonin, xanax and trazedone (not sure spelling). NOTHING worked. I finally slept last night 8 hours. Here’s what worked… I tried going to bed at 730 and by 9 I wasn’t sleeping so I went downstairs, watched a good show with sunglasses on and made sure all the lights were off. I took two Tylenol pM before the show started. During the show I kept closing my eyes and just listening .. it put me in a sleepy mood. After the show I went upstairs and fell right asleep.. I had the AC on, a 20lb weighted blanket, and a sound machine. That’s what worked for me last night. Praying it works again tonight. Do not try to go to bed too early because you will not fall asleep and you will become fixated on why you aren’t sleeping. Watch tv with sunglasses on til your so tired your eyes start shutting and then go to bed. Good luck! Insomnia sucks so bad. After my fourth night of no sleep I honestly thought about calling an ambulance to come get me and give me a sedative. It’s so horrible."
3543,hbbcbfg,,,insomnia,1630590032,"If you’re having anxiety related to the insomnia, I think you should try CBT therapy to help you overcome your fear of insomnia. I was literally having panic attacks about bedtime and I started seeing an OCD specialist, found the right antidepressant, and did therapy and my insomnia is soooo much better.

What I've found very helpful is telling myself that just lying here is good, I'm resting my body. It takes practice. But more often than not I fall asleep. Using good quality lavender oil helps loads too. Practicing good sleep hygiene is very important too.

3558,hbaucb6,,,insomnia,1630580258,"You're going to have to identify the root of your insomnia. Melatonin TELLS your body to sleep but it doesn't MAKE it sleep. It's not a sleep hypnotic like ambien, just an antidepressant. You should use it when fixing your sleep schedule, especially when doing sleep restriction.

But taking it whenever you need more sleep won't help. And you should absolutely not take MORE pills if you can't sleep, since you don't want your body naturally producing melatonin at late times. It will affect your circadian rhythm and when your body naturally begins to feel sleepy.

So use melatonin sparingly and ONLY to fix sleep schedule. If you need to keep relying on it to sleep, look for other methods like improving sleep hygiene or doing sleep restriction.

And please don't undermine sleep hygiene, it's a big factor. If melatonin actually works on you, sleep hygiene will as well."

3567,hbako8x,,,insomnia,1630572129,Update? You need an actual sleep drug to start while you sort out other things. Need to talk to a doctor and just explain the situation. None of the drugs are really habit forming and it takes awhile to find one that works well for you.
3568,hbakema,,,insomnia,1630571883,"I just got prescribed this as well, I think 25mg. I'm curious to hear back about how it works for you. I'll try to remember to let you know if it worked for me."

3570,hbaj349,,,insomnia,1630570704,I've used body scans as a type of meditation when laying down for bed. It's essentially laying down and doing a few breathing exercises while focusing your mind on different parts of your body. A good example would be deep breathing while thinking about how each part of my body feels in bed. There are good resources online if you look up body scan meditation. It's simple and effective for some.
3571,hbaj10a,,,insomnia,1630570649,"Hi, I know this is a bit late, but I just wanted to add it is VERY important that you slowly taper off the diphenhydramine as to avoid severe withdrawal symptoms.   
Please do see a doctor as well if you haven't. I'm sorry about your symptoms. I hope your symptoms get better and take care."
3572,hbaiqjs,,,insomnia,1630570390,"A side effect of too much melatonin (and also allergy medication) is sleeplessness. Be careful not to take too much at one time. If it doesn't work for you anymore, try taking it as a habit along with other steps like reading, listening to music, or anything else that relaxes you before bed. Melatonin won't make you feel tired, instead it helps you fall asleep. Just know that the best time to lay down for bed is 20 minutes after you ingest the medication. If its a chew tab, the drug is highest in your system 20 minutes after you take it. Pills are a little different but it's a good rule to follow."
3573,hbahbmu,,,insomnia,1630569162,I did this last night. 25 didn't do anything but did relax me. I took another 25 a few hours later. Realized I would be able to sleep. the next morning I COULD NOT GET UP. Was so drowsy and just rode the sleep wave since I didn't have anything scheduled. Was nice but damn it had some really delayed effects. Worlds different from Ambien.
3574,hbagvr2,,,insomnia,1630568782,It’s very very good for insomnia
3575,hbagbff,,,insomnia,1630568300,This is a legit problem for me. I guess I need to try CBT. If I need to wake up the next day at a certain time I will not fall asleep. But if I can wake up whenever I have no stress at all.
3576,hbag4yu,,,insomnia,1630568150,You're not going to the right doctors. I got Ambien so easily and it was great until I built up a tolerance. Went to a specialist and they prescribed me other stuff like Seroquel while my labs were being done. I've never encountered someone refusing to prescribe something. 3/3 doctors I've been to
3577,hbafxxr,,,insomnia,1630567988,"When two or three days go by where I can't sleep, I always take these two measures:

\- Eat a very heavy meal before going straight to bed (helps in my case cause all my blood goes to my stomach and it makes me really really drowsy). It also helps if you eat a bunch of unsalted peanuts, because they have natural properties that induce sleep.

\- Go to bed really early, like 9 pm tops

It doesn't always work, but it's my best shot. Hope you get some sleep."
3578,hbafxiq,,,insomnia,1630567977,"I am also a “silence person” but I second the above. I use the Calm app which has sleep mediations that will work for me most of the time (enough that I have paid for the premium subscription for 5 years now). If that fails I put on some calm but very descriptive songs that I can hyper focus on and create my own “videos” in my head to like they’re dreams and that usually will do the trick. 

Also, avoiding your phone for an hour before bed. For a while I would put it across the room and read a book. I also have gotten books that you fill out answers to, those make me pretty sleepy sometimes. 

When I’m not having one of my really really bad nights. I don’t have any answers to those. Once the sun starts rising and it’s time to get up, that’s when my brain says ok time to sleep."
3579,hbaffwn,,,insomnia,1630567561,I see you and I hear you. I can relate to you so much… I hope you’re able to get some relief tonight. It’s hard not to feel anxiety and dread.. what I would do for 8 hours of sleep just once.

3583,hba4rjf,,,insomnia,1630559588,"I had a six month period of pretty much what you’re talking about at least 50% or more of the time, end of last year and into this year. My low-dose Seroquel had been mostly effective for years, and it really stopped working entirely. I would have 3 day periods of only getting a little light sleep each night quite regularly.

So I decided to leave my job, and things got better right away. You know what? I realized that in addition to the intense stressors of the world around me, my personal work situation not being the right fit for me was really the primary cause, from what I can tell. I took some time off, and realized I was ready for a change. The thing I was trying to do and fit into was not the right spot.

I am thankful and privileged to be able to change my circumstances, but I really do feel we are our own barometers, and our bodies and minds give us many forms of feedback about how we’re really doing. I like to think that all of us are capable of manifesting some change that can at least bring our sleep back into alignment. That doesn’t have to mean leaving your job, or even that a key stressor is job-related. But maybe consider if your sleeping problems becoming much worse are in any way a form of feedback that can allow you to evaluate changes that may be for the better. It really worked for me. I still take my Seroquel, and it works pretty well once again."
3584,hba4erd,,,insomnia,1630559361,I’m so happy for you! Trazodone didn’t really do anything for me and I had horrible side effects.

3587,hb9zr80,,,insomnia,1630556523,"For most insomniacs Ambien is highly effective for getting one to sleep. However, it is a short acting med which lasts from 3-4 hours, so if you have maintenance insomnia you could find yourself waking up early after it wears off. But, if you only have onset insomnia, it's likely to be quite effective.

Interesting thing about Celexa is that although it's an antidepressant, it helps some people with their sleep as well."

You probably are getting deep sleep (it's almost impossible to get 0) but a lot of it is restless so it probably doesn't feel as good but know that you are almost certainly getting all zones of sleep. 

Now the bad news about hyperarousal is that it is a pretty strong learned feeling and will take a bit of time to unlearn. The good news is that it can be unlearned! I'd highly recommend you look into CBT-I, it's extremely good at dealing with hyperarousal."

You're anxiety is definitely working against you, you gotta find a way to calm down. If you could get a little bit of solid sleep, you might be able to stabilize yourself.

When I'm having a really hard time sleeping I listen to music that makes me sleepy, or I listen to ""Car Driving Down Highway In The Rain"" ASMR. Find something that calms you, and try to get the slightest bit of sleep so you can start improving your situation. If you can't manage that, you need to go see a doctor or possibly a psychiatrist.

I started at 50mg, which didn't work well. Went to 100mg and finally to 150mg which is fantastic. I'm asleep in 20 minutes after taking it. The only side effects I have are:

1) SUPER VIVID dreams. Which I actually enjoy and look forward to every night, although they might not be for everyone. 

2) It takes me probably 15-20 minutes to ""wake up"" in the morning. I feel a little zombified when I first wake up, but after that I feel refreshed and ready to take on the day. 

And lastly 3) It has a pretty short half-life. Sometimes I'll fall into a deep sleep for 2-3 hours but if I wake up again, I'm up for good and feel sort of weird. Doesn't happen often, but it does happen.

I’m stating my experience because we don’t just loose the ability to sleep, but we sure can override our body’s cues to sleep.  

You truly need to see a doctor.  I ended up seeing a therapist that helped me a great deal.  From the sounds of it you possibly need a med and non med approach (behavioral therapy).  Don’t be afraid to ask for help, sometimes a problem is just too big for us to handle on our own."

If we have pizza for dinner, I skip breakfast the next day. Conversely, if you have a big breakfast on the weekend, skip lunch. I absolutely never skip dinner, because an empty stomach causes me more insomnia. The only other thing is to try and cut out sugar. Sure ice cream once or twice a month is fine. Some chocolate here and there is fine. But not sugar every day. The final piece is that you need to start walking or doing whatever moderate exercise is best for you, daily. Throw in some push-ups if you can. Build up some muscle, as muscle burns more calories than fat."

The illusion smokers get of “relaxing” when they have a cigarette is only because they’re addicted to nicotine and having a cigarette temporarily takes the monkey off your back of needing a fix until it starts over again. Smokers are constantly on edge because they’re almost always going through withdrawal so when they have a cigarette and that feeling goes away for a few minutes it gives them the illusion they’re relaxed when it’s cigarettes that are actually making them stressed . I learned this the hard way after 15 years of smoking, once I quit my anxiety disappeared and I started sleeping like a baby. I strongly suggest quitting now before you’re in too deep , it’s a real bitch to quit ."
3715,hb6xftm,,,insomnia,1630507087,Nicotine is a stimulant so there’s that.

That said, sleep apnea might should be ruled out, this comes or really just get your sleep evaluated by a sleep study to analyze breathing/respiratory, analyze your sleep architecture (how much time your spending in each sleep stage) and more.  At a min you rule out things and begin further investigating and treatment options."
3718,hb6vod0,,,insomnia,1630506342,I know. If you wanted to take a 2 hour nap with zaleplon you could. And wake up with no side effects. Can't do that with any other sleep medication.

3723,hb6si8k,,,insomnia,1630504977,"Zolpidem is a z-drug approved for use, but the mandatory grounding is also much longer than zaleplon. A fighter pilot could take zaleplon and be flying again 4 hours later. I believe this is a 12-24 hour wait for zolpidem, even if used sublingually (brand name intermezzo). The only z drug a commercial pilot could use the night before flying is zaleplon (if it's used infrequently). Zolpidem requires 24 hours, which is pointless if they need to fly out the next day. Also, the Air Force does not routinely give fighter pilots z drugs. The Apollo astronauts took amphetamine and opioids in their medical kit, but didn't use them. They were still approved. In both cases (military and NASA) a flight surgeon must administer them."

3729,hb6lixz,,,insomnia,1630501772,"I’m sorry to hear that, my insomnia is back too after a year. At first I thought it was due to covid screwing up my schedule but it’s been 2 years, I should be used to it by now.

I’m starting to think that anxiety might be an underlying cause or one of the causes and I’m looking into treatments for that rn. Maybe you could keep a journal where you write everything down that could act as a trigger. Trial and error is usually the way to go. Good luck!"

Your doctor is partially right about the exercise, she should have expanded to say add exercise to a regular daily routine and set a wake time to start that routine centered around when you need to get ready for school.  

You're one of dozens I see on here that has your same problem.  If your on your phone, computer, video gaming devices, etc at night, stop this now and put your sleep at the top of your daily priority list. 

Itll take weeks or longer, but be consistent every day/night.  See a doctor for medication should things take a dramatic toll."

Xanax was the worst withdrawal followed by the anti depressant.  I’ve gotten down to partial ambien and partial seroquel to control my sleep with the least amount of meds possible.

I really did not like the daily withdrawal I felt from taking Xanax at night with ambien.

At least now even if I don’t sleep the best I don’t have any withdrawal or rebound anxiety as associated with a benzo."
3755,hb5mede,,,insomnia,1630475937,I’d try switching to temazepam as it should keep you asleep longer than the ambien man.

3757,hb5lk4k,,,insomnia,1630475319,"Okay.  So without outside help read as much online about how to deal with anxiety - look for treatment options and behavior based options.

Before bed you can try writing down the thoughts that are keeping you up - even just a list for “worry about it tomorrow” just gets it out if your head so you can rest.  

There are apps for sleep that have music or guided images to help you relax and not get into that overthinking cycle. 

Hope some of this helps! All the best"

The zolpidem is ambien, zopiclone or eszopiclone is lunesta which are similar but ambien has more sleep walking and memory issues.  They are considered highly addictive but my personal experience is not that. The other Z drug zapelon (sonata) is more similar to ambien.  

You’ve not got any of the antihistamines - hydroxizine, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 

Then there are tricyclic antidepressants 
Like amitriptyline or mirtazipine 

Trazadone is another antidepressant that helps with sleep for some 

Belsomra (suvorexant) is another newer med

Do all the “sleep hygiene “ stuff no screens, limit food/drink before bed etc.

I did it once and am doing it again. 

First time i went on a 2 week period of 3-4 hours a night and I absolutely lost my brains. I visited my doc who gave me Ativan, can’t do that regularly, it’s addictive! Then my pharmacist recommend trazodone. First night I took it finally slept 7 hours! And I was ready to work on myself. Slowly I after 6 weeks of consistent use I stated weening off but I kept up the habits that I made during that time and what do u know? I didn’t need the meds for another 1 year and 8 months. 

It can be fixed just gotta get up and do something"

What you need to do post haste is see your doctor. First step is getting some quality sleep even if it’s pharmaceutical. You need to be strong and able mentally, don’t let drugs scare you. I’ve been there and what worked for me was trazodone, it gives you an honest restful sleep! Once my sleep regularized and my mind was shifting back to normal I added mindfulness and sleep meditation. Check out Jon kabats videos on YouTube, I swear by them. Then eventually your body will find homeostasis again and you can ween of the drugs.

I’ve been there, and I know it’s shitty. But remember this will pass, quicker then you expect.

One other tip is journal! Even if it’s for no reason. I journaled and recovered and 2 years later booom!! Again! But I read my old journals and what do u know? I realized this too shall pass and that made this one move on a lot easier."

Cuddling with a loved one (I’m sure even a pet would work)

Taking a hot bath before bed 

Drinking hot milk (it’s weird but it’s relaxing)

Reading a boring or difficult-to-read book 

Studying another language, whether through an app or in a book

Trying to come up with a story in my head or writing one in the notes app on my phone 

If I use my Iphone, using nighttime mode (which changes the backlight color so there’s less blue light). I go a step further and go to the Accessibility menu in my Settings app, where you can find an option to use a warm filter that makes the screen even more yellow.

But the best way I’ve found when I think I’m going to have insomnia is to go to bed at what seems like an insane hour (like 8:30) and read until my eyes get tired or I start to feel drowsy. Then I lay there with my eyes closed and “rest” rather than sleep. No phone or any stimulation.

You seem to understand how much of this is self-inflicted.  That should suggest a solution.

Short term, you can try distraction from the negative and occupying thoughts.  An earworm is just one form of an occupying thought, they come in many forms.  Distraction can be as simple as counting sheep or more involved like progressive muscle relaxation.  

Longer term, you should try to get a handle on your stress about sleep and general anxiety issues.  Talk to your parents, school counselor, doctor about that.  Reach out for professional help, especially if you feel overwhelmed.

You also will benefit from much better sleep habits.  Not enough info in your post for specifics, but you should have a very consistent wake time regardless of how little you sleep -- or more likely think you sleep.  Sleep state misperception runs rampant with insomniacs, and that's usually part of the problem.

For a complete and substance free solution, check out the methods in a CBT sleep training system."

You might benefit by taking the pressure off yourself.  That could include turning off the phone about an hour before bed and keeping it off all night.  Avoid looking at the clock at all during the night, since that is reinforcing the stress about sleep and how much sleep you're missing.  Instead, just accept what you do get as OK.

This is a tough spot in life, lets not forget that and recognize that! I'm glad you are going to the ER if those messages are leaking into your brain. They will advise and treat you best.

Just remember, this too shall pass. Nothing in life is permanent. If you put the effort in you will dig yourself out of this hole and find yourself back to your normal sense in a relatively short time.

My suggestion is to start a log and log how and what you are feeling. This way if it happens again, you can reflect back and see that there truly is light at the end of the tunnel making the next time easier. Also, there doesn't have to be a next time, journaling is just good to get it off your chest.

I keep the temperature at 71 or below.


I see a therapist.

These are all things my sleep specialist recommended (among others).

I say my prayers and try to relax.


It's 2:31 am now and I'm going to sleep - I hope.

Physical symptoms like heart palpitations, breathing issues are real with anxiety.  You truly could use some anxiety and stress management strategies and techniques to help you calm, should probably see a doctor or therapist for medication that may help as well."

It doesn’t help to hear do x, y, and z when you really just need to learn how to fall asleep.”  I start work with him this weekend. He says it takes 4 sessions over 2 months and lots of hard work on my part. I’m psyched!

I have been where you are: nearly 2 years ago I freaked out in the middle of the night which lead to 2 months hardcore anxiety, and a fear of going to bed because I was going’s to pop out of bed in 2-3 hours and fuck my life. 

Anyways, all hope wasn’t lost. Within 2 months things were back to normal.

But first you must tackle the situation. I do believe solid sleep hygiene will help you! But next medication to get you over the hurdle. Go talk to your doctor there will be something out there. I’d suggest asking about trazodone - it’s not addictive and easy to come off!

You’ll get your rhythm back, start cutting the dose till your off. But so take it for atleast 2 months to make sure your sleep habits are back together."

I have weaned myself off meds and only rely on melatonin occasionally. What works for me is not to think about sleep at all. The more you want it, the more it doesn't come. I threw out the sleep hygiene advice because it is directly counter to what I love - which is either gaming till bedtime or watching TV till bedtime. 

When I feel tired enough, I go to bed. The important thing is not to look at the clock, because that just feeds the anxiety. You go to sleep when you feel tired, not when it is ""bedtime"". When my head hits the pillow, I usually am still thinking about what I just watched or just played. Don't think about sleep, just think about anything else. I find myself drifting off in no time."
4125,hb0aydz,,,insomnia,1630376202,Exercise is good for the morning and early afternoon imo. It can help you sleep later by tiring your body out physically. Not good within 4-5 hours of bedtime I’d say. It can keep you up.
4126,hb0aeti,,,insomnia,1630375942,"As someone who has had insomnia since before the advent of touchscreen everythings and since childhood as some of my first memories… I think one of the most important things is not misidentifying insomnia coping mechanisms as bad sleep hygiene(which many people who lack perspective do all the time, I get it they’re just trying to help). If you’re up doing random low energy/effort things because you just laid in bed for hours doing nothing, there’s no reason to beat yourself up about fucking blue light"
4127,hb0a1hr,,,insomnia,1630375765,Generally that’s not a good idea in the midst of being up and unable to sleep. But it can be super helpful to get an hour or two of exercise in the evening a few before trying to sleep.

So yeah. Try to sleep. If you hear/ hallucinate something, try to ignore it.
I don't understand how they prescribe it so lightly where I am. It has helped me when the insomnia gets bad, but I try to leave it as a last resort."
4142,hazzojp,,,insomnia,1630370929,"I hear what you're saying but for me, sleep hygiene is very important.  I've had insomnia for years now.  It wasn't like that when I was much younger but things change as you age.  If I sit and stare at a screen for three hours and jump into bed--I've done something that is too exciting to my brain and I can't unwind, never mind the whole blue light debate.

Try looking into sleep restriction and CBT-I for insomnia.  These have also been of great benefit for me.  You basically force yourself to stay up late, no screens for two hours before bed, and also get up very early.  Basically you want to make yourself exhausted before getting into bed, and get out of bed if you aren't sleeping.  Start with a 5 or 6 hour window of time in bed, but do not lay in bed awake--get up and read for 15-20 min then go back and try again.  It is a process but it works.  Then, if you sleep for the whole 5 hours, gradually increase your time by 30 min to try and build back up to 7-8 hours if possible.

I used to feel the same way you do, and had sleep ""anxiety"" but by using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and good sleep hygiene I am no longer anxious.  I still don't sleep great, and I probably never will but at least I can get some and be quite comfortable in bed.  I also use a variety of supplements for sleep."

4150,hazu5vs,,,insomnia,1630368338,"i’ve had trouble sleeping since i was a kid and my parents had a sleep hygiene routine to help me. i don’t remember it, but my mom says i always struggled at bedtime (insomnia is very common in my family) having consistency helped me when i was younger, but i also didn’t worry about being able to sleep. i was too young to understand and i just thought it was normal. the routine has followed me through my life, and i still tend to try and have  good sleep hygiene. however, i never connected sleep hygiene with stress about sleep. i was already in the habit before i ever understood anything about sleep. so i think it depends on the individual. if someone tries sleep hygiene when they are already having anxiety about sleep it probably will just add stress. for me it’s comforting because i’ve always done it and it’s not connected to worry at all. it’s connected to my parents and my childhood. it’s just relaxing for me. i’m not doing it to fix my sleep. naturally, if i’m more relaxed i tend to sleep a bit better, so this routine helps (not a cure tho, i have bad days) if sleep hygiene causes anxiety then it’s not going to help. so i’d say it works for some and it doesn’t work for others. if you associate sleep hygiene with the struggle and stress you have about sleep, over time it will become another source of anxiety rather than a relaxing technique. but sometimes it’s just a way to relax and that, in turn, helps with sleep. it’s not a cure. but it can help some people. i hope you find something that does help. not sleeping well is awful i understand."
4151,hazt3cl,,,insomnia,1630367823,"With 50mg I for sure sleep all the way through the night and zero wake ups and it’s very restful. But there is a hesitancyto actually get out of bed. And a little
Grogginess till my first coffee l, but smooth sailing after that.

I sleep 1245-745.

4158,hazoam4,,,insomnia,1630365579,"I think all sleep hygiene has to be fitted to the individual for different times of life. 

I think that the ideal system would include a solid metric of good sleep that you can easily take at home and a way to quickly arrive at the key variables that make the most difference in your personal sleep quality. And then after that, a strategic way to incorporate that into your daily life.

Unfortunately, that's a bit difficult. I cobbled together my own sleep self assessment that worked really well, but I had to do one variable for a week and take the test every day. And as of the last time I checked, I found wearable devices inaccurate. Hopefully that will change, or I just need to test more out.

In engineering they use statistical programming to perform multivariate tests to quickly get to the variables that have the biggest bang for your buck. I'm trying to figure out if you can do this with personal development issues like this.

Luckily the last step - making behaviors a part of your life -  might be the easiest. Habit formation has a ton of research behind it now. And there are tons of apps that make everything from blue light blockers to guided meditations more easy to incorporate. 

Some super efficient combination of all of these elements is what I see as the future of sleep hygiene, rather than static advice for all people at all times."

Dangerous mix but sometimes I am just too desperate. Try alimemazin if you havent tried it already. Not as addictive as Ambien etc and still a pretty strong medicine. At first, one did it but after some time I need 2-3 pills. It is classified as hypnoticum. More or less same effect as Rohypnol without the addictive part. Ambien is ok but that didnt do it for me. Rivotril (tranquilizer) instead of strong sleeping medication works best for me. I cant use ambien etc with it because of risk of overdose."

Sleep hygiene is great for folks that DO NOT have insomnia. In cases like ours,  sleep hygiene actually is a cause of worsening insomnia. Because you are reinforcing that sleep can be controlled and you have no control over it! It is what you call ""sleep effort"" - things you try to do in order to sleep but fail and reinforce your anxiety around sleep.

Letting go of sleep efforts is REALLY the first step in fixing your insomnia!"

1) no food past 2 pm
2) only water, no caffeine or sugary drinks (including diet drinks) past 3 pm.

I'm usually getting in bed between 10-1030 pm and am taking about forty-five minutes to get to sleep but sleeping well and getting up most days before my 6 am alarm.

It's a difficult adjustment and took me almost a month to get used to the sugar cravings and afternoon hunger, but I certainly notice when I brake these rules and I'm up until at least 2-3 am if I even sleep at all.  

I also have taken up the breathing potion of the Wim Hof method (videos on YouTube) and this causes my muscles to tense up during the breathing, but after it works like progressive muscle relaxation, but this is only for the worst nights. 

If possible try seeing a psychiatrist about possible anti-anxiety medication to take before bed to help with the really bad nights.

4249,haycw2t,,,insomnia,1630345417,"Hey u/haleandguu112. I went through something very similar, however it was alcohol/steroids induced. But, never the less, do know this too shall pass.

Throughout 2018-end of 2019, I stayed on anabolic steroids, reaching relatively high doses. Sure, I got the body I wanted but I didn't know what lay ahead. We took the kids on an all inclusive vacation for Christmas in 2019, and I drank the living bejesus out of my self. I'm talking 30-40 drinks a day.

Anyhow, return back home and 2-days later I fell asleep on the coach at 11pm, and woke up in extreme panic around 1am. DId not fall back asleep. The proceeding week I slept 1130pm - 2/3am, and my anxiety was peaking. I started fearing the bed, and just couldn't handle it anymore. My days were full of terror. 

My family doctor, similar to yours prescribed ativan, which I've always had on hand but feel very uncomfortable taking for more then 2-days. I then, was chatting to my pharmacist who recommended trazodone. And that drug changed my life at that point. I was back to sleeping 8 hours a day on DAY 1 and it was consistent. By March I had weaned my self off.

My point being, don't delay get the trazodone and get your sleep - work on the muscle relaxation, meditation, journaling and please see a psyc. Even if the anxiety goes away now, it can rear its ugly ahead again unless you tackle it head on.

I went on another drinking bender over the summer, June-August I drank pretty much everyday. and Boom 2-days after I stopped the same issue, but with shit more anxiety."
4250,hayc97z,,,insomnia,1630345153,"CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia) was what did the trick for me. I'd highly recommend a referral from your doctor to a therapist. I was unemployed and couldn't afford the co-pays at the time so I did it with an app that connected me to a coach over text.   


It takes a while to see results and some discipline, so it's not a quick fix solution but it really worked wonders for me."
4251,haybvbp,,,insomnia,1630344992,"So for me when I went through CBT-I, I had really bad health insurance and the copays were insane for an actual therapist.

I ended up using an app that connected with me a remote coach over text and gave me a sleep restriction schedule. It was useful because I'm fairly disciplined and did not need audio/video chats - if you do like that medium more, I'd recommend taking the hit on high co-pays with a therapist referral.

In the end, it was all worth it since I slept a lot better so it really depends on what kind of care you are looking for!"
4252,hay9urg,,,insomnia,1630344154,"The thing with sleeping tablets like the Z Drugs and Benzo's which are work best like nitrazepam, diazepam they all leave a hungover feeling the next day. I use them a few times a month when the insomnia gets unbearable. They will all knock me out for 7 or 8 hours but never wake up thinking that was a great refreshing sleep, but it's sleep and makes me able to function. 

Unfortunately no magic pill, they all have downside. Zopiclone  which is same class as Ambien is probably the least hungover next day, but the downside is the horrible metallic taste, can minimise this by buying empty gel capsules and put the pill in but still have a bit of that taste next day."

THis time around, my wife suggest peeing even if I don't have too. I'm usually out within 2 min of returning to bed after peeing.

I believe, it gives your brain purpose for the wakening and rationalizes your involuntary reaction to waking up."
4254,hay7n3f,,,insomnia,1630343238,"That sounds a bit like Cognitive Behavioral therapy, thanks for the idea.   


For me, one of the biggest consequences of a 9 yr battle with this is the mental attitude around sleep. I have to fight the fear / worry about sleep (e.g. not falling and staying asleep, making sure i do everything to avoid having to pee at night).   


It is hard to fall asleep as I worry about it, but the mental trick of telling myself of ""stay awake"" while doing deep breathing has helped some. I also do worry about the long term effects of taking Ambien. I try to make sure i get sunlight in the day time before 10am, exercise enough (fast walk, run, weights) to sweat for at least 30 minutes. it all helps but it is an ongoing battle."
4255,hay7enu,,,insomnia,1630343140,"Many ways; largely depends on whether you're the self-help type or not.

If not, ask your primary care doc for a referral.  Counselors, therapists, various mental health workers employ CBT methods for sleep.  It is the gold standard.

If you are, then you'll find many good resources, ranging from books to full online CBT sleep training programs.  An online search will bring up many options."

Keep in mind, though, that you actually can't die from a lack of sleep. There is not a single piece of evidence to show it. Death would likely come from an accident like falling asleep at the wheel, or operating heavy machinery at work. Just no sleep itself? Can't die.

You don't have fatal insomnia. It is one of the most rare illnesses with only a handful of cases ever recorded."

No idea why, I know that if I take my allergy meds at night and a steroid decongestant I can breathe through my nose. I physically perform better and mentally am more clear. So if you can get 8 hours of sleep and still feel like crap it's best to go to a doctor and find out why. It's usually sleep quality rather than sleep quantity."

4301,hax47km,,,insomnia,1630325315,"Wide awake the vast majority of the time. 

A lot of the time I have to force myself up and out of bed so I stop staring at the ceiling, meditate, read a book or something until I get tired enough to try to sleep again. More often than not it works, but it takes up to an hour or more sometimes.

Afterwards it's usually pretty fragmented sleep after the initial wake-up.

Example: 

1. Sleep 11-3 (4 hrs) &lt;----**typically wide awake after this**

2. Awake from 3-4 (1hr)

3. Sleep from 4 to 5:30 (1 1/2hrs) &lt;-----**After this second wake up is when I usually feel groggy**

4. Awake for 10-15 minutes. 

5. Then light sleep again for 40 minutes.

So on and so forth. After the initial wake-up sometimes I'll go for 3-4 cycles of this. Which all leave me feeling like crap. 

Usually my sleep time is between 5:30 to 6:30 hours total, at least per my watch. I'm sure I've actually nodded off probably more than my watch says, but it's so brief that it doesn't detect it. I know this because I'll be listening to music, lose track or time, look at my watch , and suddenly it's like 30 minutes later than when I last looked. Even though it feels like I had just checked it 2 minutes ago.  Regardless this also means it's super light and unrefreshing.

Edit: Writing this right now with a total of 5:04 of sleep. About to try and meditate and then try to sleep one final time. I'm doubting I'll be able to sneak more than another really brief 30 minute period."

4304,hax304n,,,insomnia,1630324566,"Doc obviously didn’t think testing was necessary, so I’d look at lowering stress as in through lifestyle changes.  Look at your diet, exercise, adding in more relaxing activities, recognize triggers that increase anxiety or notable stress you may over situations and find ways to mange those (deep breathing, meditation, muscle relaxation techniques).  If theres past unresolved issues like relationships, hardships that have caused stress etc.  

If your looking for medication or supplements, I’d check with your doctor especially if your taking any medication currently."

Do I think it will ever subside? I don't know.  I sometimes imagine myself as a old person, fat from a turkey dinner, feet up, snoring so loud it makes the grandkids laugh, but I'm only 30 so that's a little ways away.  The trick is realize that it's out of my hands really.  And that's not just insomnia, that's the universe, it's always trying to pull you apart to warm all the cold parts of itself, it's an eternal struggle that you can't win, so like insomnia, I don't fight it.  if shit isn't going my way, if some hardcore trauma is happening, whatever it is, I have to put that into perspective and take a breath, remember all the moments that brought me there, all I've survived, and it becomes much easier to call myself out for moments of rage or wallowing or griping, and then those frustrations fade into a realization that I'm fighting an unwinnable fight and I should just smile and remember that at least in that moment I'm bringing the fight to it, simply by remaining alive."

I mean fully awake for days because I’d start to get sleep anxiety about knowing I wasn’t going to sleep well and that would intensify the problem. So I initially required a much higher than average dose of 300mg (I also had a heavy tolerance to depressants from taking large doses of Ambien, benzodiazepines, trazodone, etc. prior). I eventually cut that dose to 150mg and now about 5 years later, I only need ~12mg (half of a 25mg). Most people will find 25mg or less effective I imagine so my recommendation would be to start low. Also helps you avoid some of the side effects such as next day sluggishness/sleepiness and increased appetite. I have none of that on a low dose and it works consistently well, I sleep great these days."

HELL NO!

It is no fun and while the relaxation doesn't make you feel every second, you do feel the time.  It isn't preferable.

But if sleep is not working and there are no good solutions then what I am saying is don't stress, don't make it worse by tossing and turning and worrying.

Just be as chill as possible.

4316,hax040n,,,insomnia,1630322697,"Well its complicated is the answer.  I did hard substances for almost a decade starting when I was 17 to escape the insomnia and a bunch of other stuff.  When I got clean I didn't have a choice.  Normal people can toss and turn and the worst that could happen is they feel like utter shit.  In my case it was and is a trigger, so in order to stay alive (the irony of your question) I must live with staying awake all the time.  I would take meds to help, but the one that helps me the most is also triggering lol, when I first got clean I drank to sleep but it made it worse in the long run.  And no, I don't know anyone in that exact situation, but many people who quit hard opiates (methadone, suboxone and fentanyl seem to be the worst offenders) take many months for sleep to return to normal, habit length considering. 

It's not all peaches and cream though because of sleep debt.  I have to be very careful driving, I've had bad falls (like straight old people falls), I see shadows constantly in the corners of my eyes, sometimes the like thought-to-speech part of my brain wigs out and I garble sentences lol.  On top of all this bullshit I have AIWS, so a few times a year I go thru a grab bag of that lol.  IDK to be honest, a life like mine you either get tough or get dead, that's really all there is to it.

4347,hawneb4,,,insomnia,1630312444,"It's not acute like that. Acute sudden insomnia is usually triggered by anxiety. About 1,000,000 times more people have one episode of this in their life then go back to sleeping normally."
4348,hawn0rl,,,insomnia,1630312110,"Health anxiety sucks, insomnia sucks more when we have health anxiety its acerbated  by not sleeping.  You do not have any form of fatal insomnia, just regular insomnia.  First stages are not insomnia, fatal insomnia is an extreme neurological genetic disease and you don’t have it."
4349,hawmj1o,,,insomnia,1630311673,"The nerve block contains a corticosteroid, these are notorious for causing insomnia.  I have quite a story with 1 of these injections later having betamethazone shots for rotator cuff/tendinitis. 

I can say, this doesn’t last forever.  Eventually it will subside but getting over that point is a different story.  Your most likely not going to have consequences from the diphenhydramine alone, but coadministering the benzo with it isn’t the proper way to manage your insomnia.  

You should really see if a doctor can assist and advise if there’s a therapy that’s right for your particular circumstance. The supplements you listed are too weak to treat insomnia, they may help with onset issues but cannot help you maintain sleep.  Talk to your doctor about insomnia being a side effect of the medication treatment you were given.  I’m so sorry your suffering like this, I know all to well how this feels."

I also have a lot of health anxiety, so I know all too well how we can end up circling around irrational fears, but it's not your fault. Don't beat yourself up over it. 

You don't have it. It's literally one of the rarest diseases in the world. You're more likely to win the lottery a dozen times over and get struck by an asteroid than to have this disease. And if that isn't enough to make you feel better, insomnia itself isn't even an early presenting symptom based on the case reports. A lot of other neurological shit (none of which you described) goes down before the insomnia. You don't have it. You can rest easy with this.

In my case, also many times I felt like someone was violating me and strangling me at the same time and I couldn’t move either or open my eyes, but I was aware of what was happening. It was terrifying. For me it all started mid summer last year with the pandemic. I was having outbursts of anxiety attacks and asthma related symptoms then the sleep paralysis was getting worse I couldn’t sleep for days. It subsided after my asthma got under control and my doctor prescribed an anxiety medication that has been working wonders since.

Firstly I was prescribed trazadone and that sort of helped me. Mostly though, don’t lay down unless you’re for so tired you know you’ll sleep, if you lay down and don’t fall asleep within the first 30 mins to an hour get up and do something, clean or read a book or watch tv. You need to train your brain that bed means sleep. Get up early even if you’re tired and do things throughout the day to tire you out enough for you to be too tired at night that you need to sleep. Don’t sleep throughout the day. What I would do most nights is put a movie or show on my phone and just let it play, the background noice would help me. Those are a few things that helped me, still it took me a while to start sleeping and get my schedule back on track but I really hope some of these things help you.

Can confirm THC gummies are very effective, for myself they only give me three hrs sleep though.  The sleep comes at a cost of quality of sleep as well since THC effects REM.  But with a try.  

After you’ve exhausted methods that aren’t working out too well, see your doctor.  Discuss your sleep, habits and conditions that may be effecting your sleep, stress or anxiety, a lot of times we are exacerbating our sleep issues, but also we could have underlying causes or deficiencies or excess stress that could use a little guidance and even med help as we work through them."

4379,havjxkc,,,insomnia,1630287241,"There isn’t really that perfect pill for sedation you’re looking for.  Ambien truly blacks me out, it’s terrible sleep for me, but for another it works great.  Lunesta works okay, I don’t get side effects next day but it looses its effects on me fairly quickly, like a few days.  Traz was an amazing med but I took it nightly way too many years and hell to come off it.  Benzos are the last resort meds, but these come at a high price in the name of tolerance quickly, awful withdrawal. 

What I’m trying to say what med works for one doesn’t work for another.  Some need a couple of meds although I’ve yet to figure out how some are doubling or tripling different meds to sleep and go to work, school, etc the next day.  

There’s also the possibility that you could rotate out meds so you don’t build tolerance.  That’s what I do, some do this more successfully than I do.  I’m willing to sleep like crap a few nights to avoid tolerance, withdrawal and rebound insomnia.  I’m just making some valid points to consider, voicing my own anecdotal experience.  You’re right as well in that everything comes down to your doctor and what’s he’s willing to try and work with you on therapies that suit your needs.  I hope you find something that works."

-eye mask so I can’t open my eyes easily 
-a dark room or maybe a warm nightlight 
-be as comfortable as possible 
-cannabis (is possible where you are) 
-I have found mitazapine has been the best medication for me. Zopiclone stops working really easily and messes you up. 
-I had an extremely long bedtime routine. I need at least two hours to transition into sleep. 
-If I toss and turn for over an hour I turn on my light and do something to distract myself. I leave my bed if possible, then come back in 5-10 min and try to sleep.

The point is that I am far too good the next day and got not near enough or in some cases no actual sleep.

Getting close to sleep IS enough, ok, maybe you don't feel as good as a full night of deep restful sleep, but you'll feel better than you have any right to.

Yet as I said, if I get zero sleep and stay up doing stuff by morning I'm a mess and midday I'm almost ""please shoot me"" bad.

4425,hauur4f,,,insomnia,1630275131,"Get into meditation in a SERIOUS way. There is a long tradition of yogis who meditate deeply and regularly getting to a point where they need little to no sleep, as the state of *deep* meditation can supplant some of what's achieved in the sleep state. I'm not talking about doing 20-minute guided meditations, I'm talking about meditating for hours at a time without any aid. You won't start there, you will build up to it, but I think there's a chance it could help. It might even help with other issues you experience, due to the brain injury or other things entirely.

This will not be a trivial process, but if you've exhausted every other option, what do you have to lose?

I'm a chronic insomniac btw, and while I've never had serious suicidal ideation from my situation at its worst points, I've definitely had the feeling of ""dying would be better than this shit."" A lot of hardcore chronic insomniacs deal with this, I imagine. Unless you've been there, it's tough for people to imagine what going days and days without almost any sleep is like. There's a reason it's literally used as a form of torture.

Try checking out r/Meditation, and I would be happy to lend any advice if it's useful.

Also, I'm not sure if you consider yourself ""spiritual"" at all (that word doesn't resonate with me personally, but what it implies is something I am quite oriented around). Consider pursuing this path, which meditation is a key component of. Pray. Ask for help from sources of aid beyond this mundane form of reality. Happy to recommend some books and resources in this vein, if you're interested.

Just out of curiosity, do your doctors/therapists feel there is a link between your brain injury and the insomnia? I assume you have doctors that are very aware of your challenges? Do they know you are actively suicidally ideating? This is something you should be sharing with them."

Most insomniacs benefit by turning off the phone completely about an hour before bed and keeping it off all night until morning.

There is some benefit from reflecting on the day and planning for tomorrow before bed, but one doesn't necessarily need anyone else to do that.

And deep abdominal breathing is known to help induce the relaxation response, and is often used as an in-bed method to help fall asleep.  Devices or apps are in that case superfluous.

Sometimes the tech can help -- other times it can interfere."
4429,haut3nv,,,insomnia,1630274389,"I'll be honest I haven't read your original post but besides my weird energy thing, I have the following tips for dealing with Insomnia...

\#1, You don't need sleep!  That is my conclusion, you can function normally with almost no sleep for a week or more in my experience.  Ok, now maybe there is a degree of paradoxical insomnia in there but if you just ""meditate"" you really don't need sleep, okay I don't do what I consider to be meditation, I'm hoping I will fall asleep but if I don't go to bed I am a wreck the next day, even by 6am I'm a mess and by midday I am jittery wired overtired and feel incredibly awful.  But if I spend 8+ hours with my eyes closed thinking a few thoughts as I can while being apparently aware I am fine the next day.  Ig you google meditation replacing sleep it is a thing.

\#2, Go to bed fully clothed!  This works 2 ways, it helps to break a cycle of insomnia by reminding your body of times you were so ready to sleep you went to bed or fell asleep out of bed wherever you happened to be, this is like using an anchor to get back to that state and it works but you can't use it too often.  Secondly it makes for a difference from all the other nights when you couldn't sleep, it feels different, so you disconnect from bad sleepless conditioning and connect to good conditioning.

\#3, Maybe you are getting too much sleep?  Ok, so the theory with this one is sleep pressure and it does work, what you do is don't go to bed one night, stay up and do stuff, next night go to bed at a good bed time and assuming you sleep don't sleep for more than say 3-4 hours, the next night go to bed at the same tie and extend your sleeping time to no more than say an extra half hour, keep extending each night till you feel okay when you wake up but the key to this is keeping sleep pressure high and not sleeping so much you run out of sleep pressure.

It is worth noting that many pro athletes might only sleep for 5-6 hours in the off season but sleep for 12-16 hours when playing.  The point is the amount of sleep we need varies by activity and if you have too much sleep it can lead to difficulty getting to sleep, the other tip being not to go to bed based on the clock but based on being properly tired."
4430,hausuy1,,,insomnia,1630274280,"You are right about two things -- wanting to change away from alcohol, it is one of the worst things you can do for sleep, and the second is to avoid substances that only mask the problem and leave the underlying root issues unaddressed.

Start with your doctor to ensure no untreated medical issues are causing this.  Your doc may also be able to provide something short term to help you transition.  Ask about using a CBT sleep training system -- it is the standard of care for primary insomnia, completely substance free, and represents a permanent solution for most who try it."
4431,hausiwc,,,insomnia,1630274127,"You likely are experiencing at least some disruption to your circadian rhythm -- and that, along with your sleep drive, is what largely controls sleep.

You will help yourself by doing two things.  One is establishing a very consistent sleep schedule, and that means a consistent wake time every day without sleeping in.  That's what sets and regulates your body clock.  Realistically, it could take several weeks of consistency to fully reset it.

The second is to get a handle on your psychiatric issues.  Are you getting counseling?  There are solutions that work.  Reach out for help, it is there."

Even if you get 1 or 2 hours, that’s something. I say this as I just had a week with averaging just a couple hours per night so I can relate. You’re gonna make it worse when you keep telling yourself you haven’t slept. Take an hour of sleep as something.

Now, CBD is very safe. They legally have to put warnings on the bottle because there may always be a chance. 

You seem to be in the same position as me. What I would recommend is seeing a doctor and going to meds. That’s what I am in the process of doing. Also need to get negative thoughts out of your head. Instead of saying I didn’t sleep, be honest and say well I got a couple hours."
4454,hau7l22,,,insomnia,1630265009,Sure
4455,hau7h1n,,,insomnia,1630264960,"&gt;I still haven't tried my CBD oil but I'm scared because it says on the back that in the state of California it can cause cancer, reproductive harm, or birth defects. It only has 0.3% CBD.

Yeah I would completely ignore that. 

&gt;The Prop 65 label is like a noisy alarm that rings equally loudly about smaller amounts of low-risk substances and huge amounts of potentially harmful chemicals. The labels don’t say how much of the chemical is present, or how much it would really take to make a person sick. You could get the same alarming label on potato chips (acrylamide), chemotherapy (uracil mustard), lumber (wood dust), or toxic runoff (arsenic). It’s obviously helpful to be alerted to the presence of potentially harmful chemicals. 

&gt;But not all doses of these different chemicals mean the same thing.
Imagine if a warning label accompanied every risk you took on a regular basis, from driving on the freeway to baking gel nail polish under UV light. **Fear is powerful, but it should be commensurate with the danger, and the Prop 65 label tends to equalize risk in a way that actually might actively harm people’s ability to judge danger.**

https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/what-is-prop-65/

There is a good argument to be made that the prop 65 label may actually be causing more problems than it solves. Due to the aforementioned. 

It's hard to distinguish what are real threats if all companies are labeling everything as a potential cancer hazard, out of an abduance of caution and to try and avoid liability/legal issues down the line."

If I did, I was asymptomatic during the actual infection. I've also been fully vaxxed since mid April. As previously stated, this started mid June.

4459,hau546l,,,insomnia,1630263946,"Thanks for the tip. Really trying to avoid the Benzo route. As I mentioned. I only take 1mg tops, and 95% of the time it's only like .5mg. 

I try to keep Benzo use to the absolute minimum so I feel that both those doses are still pretty effective for me. 

Which also means that I feel a bit off the next day, which I'm assuming is due to the very long half-life of Klonopin. Off in a short term memory sense. It's not horrible for me, but since I'm a historically super anxious person I seem to be hypervigilant whenever I notice a difference in my body/thought process.

 I'm sure that's part of the reason I'm getting all these hypnic jerks, because I'm focused on bodily sensations. 

I MAY try to up the dose to 2mg for a night though....just to see if maybe that does the trick.

I know everyone is different, but just out of  curiousity. Do you notice increased side effects at 2mg of Klonopin?"

4475,hatmpbn,,,insomnia,1630256218,"I was in the process of weaning off Clonazepam when it started. I had been slowly tapering from 1mg daily and got down to 0.25mg when the zaps started. I stopped the taper and started taking 1mg again because I thought it could be withdrawal symptoms, but I still get the zaps every day even after going back to my original dose .

I think anxiety is a good theory, and I've also been thinking  it could be due to chronic sleep deprivation. Ever since these symptoms started I've noticed that my sleep is very fragmented and unrefreshing. I always wake 2-3 times per night and have multiple vivid dreams as soon as I fall back asleep, meaning I'm getting a lot of Rebound REM and little Deep Sleep.

Did you get a lot of dreams per night when you were at your worst? If so, the fragmented sleep could be the issue. If not, maybe it is the benzos after all."
4476,hatlz03,,,insomnia,1630255924,"Nope, you're not going to die today.  You don't have fatal insomnia either, its an extremely rare neurological genetic disease.  

As far as Benadryl, it can make you feel like crap the next day as in 1) its effect on sleep quality is fairly significant 2) next day hangover, sleepiness and other side effects possibl especially coupled with less quality sleep.. 

You have what sounds like is severe health anxiety, this is a tough form of anxiety to manage."
4477,hatks77,,,insomnia,1630255453,"I know what you're dealing with -- it's not something I deal with any more, but I've been there. In many ways, falling asleep and waking back up is like a ""mini-death"" of sorts. I also have low-level OCD, which mostly manifests as BFRB (skin-picking), and who knows, this may be a contributor.

You know what actually helped me (on a nightly basis, when I was still wrestling with this discomfort at times)? Reminding myself that this is something I've literally done almost every day since I was born, and it's never gone terribly awry to date. I always wake back up. Maybe one day I won't, but so far, I always have, and the chances I'll wake back up after any given night of sleep, at this point in life anyway, is as close to 100% as anything gets.

Someone else mentioned that a fear of or wrestling with mortality may be at play. This was a big factor for me, I think. Would you believe it was actually having a minor (and somewhat unexplained) heart attack a couple years ago that somehow seemed to move me beyond that fixation? I just kind of let it go. I think perhaps it was because for a day or so there, I had no idea what kind of shape I was in, and what would happen moving forward. And I was OK with it. Ever since, the fixation really lifted. I think this can be done without having a heart attack.

And FYI -- don't go way too hard on a Peloton stationary bike! Moderation is the key, heh."

I'm not sure that's what caused it but I've seen people mention mirtazapine or SSRI's caused it for them. 

It did go away for me within a couple months. While I was having the problem, I ended up going back on mirtazapine again, and then I was also taking low dose xanax for a few weeks to sleep. The two together really helped with the problem. Then I slowly decreased the amount of xanax to 0, and it didn't come back, and I'm still on mirtazapine.

4483,hatif9y,,,insomnia,1630254492,"I can really relate to your post, including the part about Dignitas. I've considered it as well. I'm curious, are you able to nap at all? Perhaps you can get your brain a little more rest by scattering in some naps in addition to your 1-2 hours.

The other recommendation is if you find benzos do help you, you might be able to use them less frequently and not develop as much of a tolerance. For example, if you take a short acting one like temazepam 3 times a week, skipping nights in between.

I wish I had a cure to offer, but I think when it's this severe it may come down to just finding the small changes that can make one's quality of life a little better, at least until something better comes along. I hope you can hang in there."

Thanks for your reply. Here's the answers:

How long exactly have you had insomnia for? - 15 years. The last 2 years it has gotten significantly worse.  
Do you remember how the insomnia began? For example, mine began when I realised I couldn't fix my sleep schedule on the holidays. - I took a recreational drug.   
How quickly did it take for your insomnia to progress to what it is now? Was it immediately bad all of a sudden, or was it getting gradually worse? It got worse whenever I took drugs, although I didn't realise this was the cause until it was too late.  
Do you believe there are stressors in your life contributing to your insomnia? My brain is racing 100% of the time, even when there aren't any stressful situations.   
Any mental health problems contributing to your insomnia? - I had depression, but I don't anymore.   
How often do you exercise if you do? And what times? Most days. Early in the day.   
Do you do any really intensive activities? Like working at really late times for example? I haven't worked for 2 years. Unable to commit to anything long term at the moment.  
Any problems related to anxiety? Shallow breathing is an example. I sweat really easily now.  
When you wake up, do you feel like you can go back to sleep? - No. I never feel tired or drowsy. I just wake up and I'm wired.  
Do you not feel tired, or do you feel tired but still can't sleep anyway? I feel exhausted all day in my body, but my brain would never let me sleep."

4523,hat0mk5,,,insomnia,1630246902,"I'm really sorry you're dealing with this, if your insomnia is definitely caused by the brain damage (i.e. you never had problems with sleep before that), then a lot of the normal interventions that target anxiety probably won't help you, but it's worth trying something like CBTi and sleep hygiene just in case. 

Have you tried any meds with anti-histamine properties? In my experience you develop a tolerance to benzos much faster than those. Mirtazapine is a prescription med that works extremely well for me. Trazodone was even stronger (felt like someone had hit me with a tranquilizer dart within minutes), but the side effects were too strong for me personally. Unisom is an OTC anti-histamine option that honestly works a lot better for me than benzos. Maybe you can have an arsenal of several different meds and rotate between them when you develop tolerance to one?"

4526,hasyup9,,,insomnia,1630246077,"Hey man, what a scary thing to go through. I didn't start experiencing this until my later 20's. Apparently this is not an uncommon experience to have.

I would urge you to get a sleep study done to check for obstructive sleep apnea. Have you ever been told that you snore while asleep? Have you ever woken yourself up from gasping for air? Nightmares about drowning/suffocation? If yes, this is a signal from your body. Your waking brains fears going to sleep because you aren't breathing properly when you have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea makes it so you stop breathing periodically.

If you do get the test done and you do have sleep apnea, you will be given a CPAP machine to help you breathe.

Very often people with sleep apnea get diagnosed with a bunch of other things like insomnia, anxiety, depression, adhd, etc because  a lack of sleep affects your entire being. If your body hasn't gotten proper rest it will be impossible to have your mind at rest as well.

Please talk with your doctor about getting a sleep study. If you want to know more about what happens during a sleep study please ask :)"

4535,hastnah,,,insomnia,1630243547,Thanks. I am already getting support but I still havent went to a sleep specialist so that is probably something I should try out. I crashed yesterday for a few hours. Someone in the comments said that 5 days was their limit. I have never gone more than 5 days before I collapse. I didnt sleep a lot though. I usually crash for at least 24 hours. I have an emergency backdoor number to the ER which I can call if it gets bad. I should probably have used it yesterday. They can drive to my home and have a check on me so I dont neccessarily have to go to the hospital. Usually I have to if its been 5 days though to check that I didnt get braindamage or something. They also take the hallucinations quite seriously and sometimes send me to the psych ward for a few days. I am diagnosed with C-PTSD. They also say that I have some symptoms of Schizophrenia which I was diagnosed with before but that it may just be the PTSD causing the hallucinations.
4536,hastkr7,,,insomnia,1630243510,"I think what you probably really need is to make an appointment with a sleep disorders doctor and do a sleep study.   Things that can cause sleep problems are alcohol, tranquilizers any Street drugs and caffeine.  Stress is a major culprit, but it will subside. If you have no problem with any of the above you need to be diagnosed by a doctor.  Depression can also affect your sleep.  More than likely it's time for professional opinion's."
4537,hasr47i,,,insomnia,1630242205,Yes! Thank you.
4538,haspe19,,,insomnia,1630241221,"I would highly recommend staying on this subreddit and just reading posts every day. There are a lot of people with bad insomnia, like you, but I don't think brain damaged. I also recommend seeing a sleep therapist if you haven't already.

If pills can help you sleep, I'm tending to believe that if your insomnia can be alleviated albeit with use of medication then it can be cured as well. There's really a lot of questions you need to ask yourself to combat your insomnia, and a lot of it is learning to understand your own body.

Insomnia is a long journey but you gotta make use of the experience it gives you.

Here are a few questions:

1. How long exactly have you had insomnia for?
2. Do you remember how the insomnia began? For example, mine began when I realised I couldn't fix my sleep schedule on the holidays.
3. How quickly did it take for your insomnia to progress to what it is now? Was it immediately bad all of a sudden, or was it getting gradually worse?
4. Do you believe there are stressors in your life contributing to your insomnia?
5. Any mental health problems contributing to your insomnia?
6. How often do you exercise if you do? And what times?
7. Do you do any really intensive activities? Like working at really late times for example?
8. Any problems related to anxiety? Shallow breathing is an example.
9. When you wake up, do you feel like you can go back to sleep?
10. Do you not feel tired, or do you feel tired but still can't sleep anyway?

EDIT: There is a guy called u/aether22. Look for him, he is testing a completely harmless method of treating insomnia and it's worth a shot."

But, in real terms, you are extremely unlikely to die in your teenage years. It seems unusual that you are troubled by the concept of death at your age, but if you can come to the point of accepting mortality, I think it would help. 

It delivers a kind of peace, even though that is a paradox. 

A significant amount of CBT these days is based on the concept of acceptance . 

As far as your experience is being triggered by any other real condition, I would recommend seeking professional help.

Don't worry about how this could happen, just display the image on an LCD monitor (ideally) but you don't need to and shouldn't really look at it, you want it going past you, to the side.

So I experienced this when I had the laptop on my lap and I lay back a bit, I found myself nodding up while the image if projected right out would have (I think) gone over my face.

I am currently sitting with several printed versions (I suspect LCD screen is more likely to work) sitting on the couch and table around me, with the base of the triangle facing me (just as it was when on the laptop on my, er lap).

I can assure you that while it sounds out there, this type of energy is real and is affected by shape."

How long do you have to stay up before the crash comes? I recommend staying in this subreddit and looking at it on a daily basis. You will learn many things to deal with your insomnia. Once your crash comes, I recommend doing something called sleep restriction. Instead of allowing yourself to crash and catch up on sleep, restrict your hours of sleep.

If you get 4-5 hours of sleep and struggle to wake up, it's probably high quality sleep. If you get low quality sleep, you would normally feel fatigued but not lethargic.

You say you've had insomnia since 4, but I reckon there are good prospects for a full recovery. I'm a bit lazy right now but you'll definitely find the answers you need on this subreddit. People ask very similar questions to you every day, try and find their posts and the answers they received"

I would also try my best to tire myself out throughout the day so at night I would be so tired I could just try to sleep a little easier. I was prescribed trazadone  and that helped me some nights too. I think one of the best things is just getting up really early, even if you’re really tired and try your best to not sleep during the day, tire yourself out, hopefully by the end of the day you’ll be way too tired to think about those things and just sleep.

Nah it's more of something that is like new age chi woowoo sounding.

Basically all you need to do is display a simple geometric image (you don't even need to look at it) for at least an hour before bed, and maybe next to your bed as you try and sleep.

It can be printed I guess but displayed on a screen is preferred.

Basically physics agrees there is more in space than just light and matter, but what I have found is what has been termed sacred geometry (though this is not based on actually established sacred geometry, it is of my own design) which is to say shape that can influence something in the background of space.

Light is a physical phenomena that can affect matter and so it can also affect this other stuff in space.

I have proven to many the reality of this phenomena, anyway I have made a design that is very relaxing or at least it put me to sleep this morning after I had a great night sleep.

So while it might sound hard to believe it doesn't cost you anything, just try it out and give feedback.

Message me because I don't want to put this image out and lose track of it, one day I might sell it.

It might be to crazy for you but really where's the harm?"

4613,haryt4q,,,insomnia,1630219807,"I have two pieces of advice.

First one there is a method of solving insomnia where you don't go to bed one night and stay up till the next night, then you go to bed at the right time for bed but only let yourself sleep say 3 hours, then you get woken up.

The next night you go to bed at the same time and you sleep for just 3.5 hours.

Next night 4 hours, then 4.5, and 5 then 5.5 and 6...

Increasing by half an hour (or 20 mins as you get longer) till you find a level that is enough sleep but not too much.

The idea is that by having an 11 hour sleep your sleep pressure has lifted too much to easily get to sleep the next night.

The next suggestion I have is that you message me but you have to be open minded, I might have a solution to insomnia, won't hurt to try it."

4622,harsmii,,,insomnia,1630215125,"Agree with u/J_Ryker, you need medical assistance.  What you are going through is sleep deprivation.  It can cause auditory and visual hallucinations.  What you’re seeing in the closet and likely corners or anywhere else dark and shadowy are “shadow people”.  You can see them in the shadows and almost make them out but not quite.  You’ll see them moving around in the dark.  They aren’t real, they are your exhausted mind trying to make sense of the sensory input when it’s too fatigued to do so properly.  Left untreated and allowed to progress this can become psychosis.  It only gets worse from there.  Get to a doctor and get something to help you get some rest."

4631,hari6lh,,,insomnia,1630208481,I am on 50-100 mg based on stress level. Right now I'm at 100 and the acid reflux and morning grogginess is hitting me hard. I will try to lower it to 75 then hopefully 50mg soon. Another thing is I've heard for sleep some of the generics are ones that dissolve quickly and I have to take it with just barely enough water so it works properly. If your having trouble try googling quick dissolve Trazodone and whatever the generic manufacturer is for yours or just talk to the pharmacist about it.

Let me tell you I’ve had none of that with this medicine the past few day’s I’ve felt like professor clump! I’m always hungry I eat and I eat and I’m still hungry.

4659,haqf694,,,insomnia,1630188361,You may be dealing with an underlying anxiety disorder?
4660,haqdps7,,,insomnia,1630187664,"Getting out of bed when you can't sleep and doing stuff is stimulating to the brain. For many it makes their insomnia worse because you are conditioning your brain to get up and do stuff whenever you go to bed.  However, laying in bed tossing and turning can associate your bed with being awake. 

The key is to remain in bed and become relaxed. One of the most effective ways of doing this is by using the ACT-i program. Read ""The Sleep Book"" by Dr Guy Meadows which includes the ACT-i program and so much more. You'll be amazed at the amount of information you'll learn about sleep and insomnia even if you decide not to use the ACT-i program. ACT-i is far more effective that CBT-i. Dr Meadows shifted his insomniac patients from CBT-i to ACT-i because he found that CBT-i wasn't effective for most of his patients."

4662,haq5vhu,,,insomnia,1630184025,"I had the best long sleep yesterday after getting the vaccine on Friday evening. I slept through all of Saturday.

It was a nice sleep but now it’s early Sunday morning and I’m wide awake lol"
4663,haq5kyu,,,insomnia,1630183894,"Lmfao no. Well I mean, I have severe ADHD so time legitimately doesn't exist for me usually, like I legitimately can not tell 15 minute from 2.5 hours of passing. And the other thing with the rule, is that you're not supposed to look at clocks or your phone because of anxiety etc. So like eventually, I'll cave and think idk, maybe 30 minutes passed and it's 3 hours passed, so then I just go on my phone because I already fucked up the rule, and then the light rule so w.e 

It's funny asf, because literally the last time I fell asleep in 15 minutes was when I went to take a powernap, while at the peak of 40 mgs dextro-amphetamine sulfate which is about 20% stronger than Adderall for reference, because I was able to feel calm and not hyper and control my breathing. 

But long story short,  I got injured and such, and many things disrupted my sleep which ruins the effects of my meds from working. So I kinda don't take them at this point because why the hell would I? Increase tolerance for a placebo basically. But usually when ever I stop my meds, shit hits the fan in all domains of my life tbh. But they're not really going to do much rn anyway. 

The problem is that my doctor is like anti sedatives, like all sedatives, not even because I'm on a stimulant typically, that I'm not anymore because well, its not going to work again unless I sleep so taking it accomplishes fuck all. Not even in the short term which is all I need is like 10 days or something, with a strong ass sedative that lasts long. And my only goal is sleeping and everything else can fuck off. Because your body just releases way too much stress hormones at a certain point of deprivation, like no matter what behavioral thing I've tried, my body constantly feels like I'm in the middle of the Vietnam War all day long and when I somehow pass out from exhaustion, for a few hours, I'm not even confident I actually ever sleeped. I can't recall it the last time I knew I for sure sleeped. I'm cold turkey withdrawaling from amphetamine, and most people complain about hypersomnia, and I can't fucking sleep in 2 days and maybe 5 hours I don't even know if I sleeped if I do. 

So sometimes you have to be realistic and treat sleep disorders and not ignore them like I did and other shit, but everytime I go for anything related to sleep its brushed under the rug when going to the doctor is my very, very last choice before stupid behavioral interventions that accomplished Jack shit. Maybe when it's not really bad and is very, mild. 

But no, behavioral interventions when it's actually serious makes it worse because it stops you from getting more apt and reasonable treatment, and cause more permanent brain damage in doing so and also worsens the circadian disruption. So idk what fantasy the 20 minute rule is, I think it's basically if you have good sleep and are going to essentially fall asleep in 15 minutes regardless. Like maybe, if you missed a few hours the previous night, if that. Other than that every attempt at using it has fucked up my predicament worse and I go by 30 minutes, but I'm about to give up on any attempts at self preservance real fucking soon tbh. Like I'm probably 1 step from being given another hoop to jump through, and just never attempting to medicate or treat my adhd, and actually just go do like PCP or someshit as the dementia kicks or, or just stare at the wall. 

It's a shame, I was actually really smart 2 years ago, like extremely in school. But depression bc people died, social isolation, toxic break up, school, I also stopped my meds bc I stopped caring and much more. And now I'm 18 and about done. Actually useless. And I'm not even remotely close to being depressed about it, im pretty sure that's just because of the brain damage because rationally there's 0 reason to not be depressed. But yeah, treat sleep issues seriously, fuck the goofy shit, in the long term behavioral interventions help a lot but they're not going to work in the bad cases."

I don’t sleep often and I have learned to live with it. Instead of fighting the urge to sleep every night I sleep when I am tired. Of course you should not sleep during the day because you will miss work, your friends, and the sun.

I will not sleep for 2-3 days and i go to bed at night but only when I am tired. I like to read the Bible at night play video games or watch tv, cook meals for the week, journal, shower, organize/clean, do laundry, go for a walk or run, work out, etc. you can literally do mostly everything that doesn’t include anyone else.

Now here’s the thing you just don’t sleep.

You live a completely normal life but only sleep every other night. I feel very productive when I can’t sleep. It’s like my mind is too busy and doesn’t want to waste the time sleeping. 

All I want to say is believe that this is not bad and make it not bad. Make this into a good thing. Because honestly it’s a great feeling going to bed at 8pm exhausted from 2-3 days of hard work. You wake up in the morning and you do it again.

If this doesn’t solve or fix anything you might be depressed. Talk with someone. Share your feelings with someone who will listen. And always remember God loves you🙂"

I take is Lunesta worked well for you? I like trazadone but it seemed to more reinforce sleep I would otherwise get rather than extending it. I think I slept deeper and maybe better for those hours but I still couldn't get enough sleep.

NO ELECTRONIC DEVICES between shower and bedtime.  Keep a glass of water on the nightstand in case you wake up thirsty.  Turn phone notifications off, turn vibrate off, play sound rain, creek, or static sound while you sleep (no music or voices, must be white noise).  Sleep with phone screen down so you don’t see light.  Set alarm on your phone.  Don’t get out of bed, don’t look at clock until your alarm on your phone goes off.

4721,haobgzq,,,insomnia,1630153848,"Sorry to hear.  I am currently using trazadone and it helps but it also stuffs up my nose which then makes it tough to sleep so not sure if its going to work...

I can relate to the exercise fatigue as well--I used to get really worn out after doing anything cardio related.  I'm still not nor will I ever be a jogger.  Maybe try something really light for exercise, like brisk walking or biking?  Gotta keep moving.  Some light weight lifting is always great too.

I used to sleep 5-6 hours a night but that has diminished to just 'light' sleep for the night.  I guess its my genetics.

Keep a regular routine and good sleep hygiene help me a ton too.  In and out of bed at same times, you can try sleep restriction which can be pretty effective (look up CBT-I for sleep if interested).  Of course diet and exercise.

Personally, I have found ashwagandha to be incredibly useful for fatigue as well as anxiety.  Can be used during the day or at bedtime, depending on what you use it for.  I take tumeric for inflammation due to insomnia stresses and good multiviamins, fish oil, and magnesium and vit C.  Its important to replenish the things that poor sleep deplete."
4722,hao8z2t,,,insomnia,1630152344,"Unless you have health issue, I think the secret to sleeping is to not focus on your sleep. It’s like when you focus on your breathing and then you start breathing manually controlling your every inspirations and expirations on purpose.

I think you should look at what you do during the day, time spent in front of screen ? Activities and sports ? To spend as much energy as you can and focus on something else than your sleep issues. What food do you eat at night ? Drinking coffee ?

And it can be hard to do the effort to change your daily routine with 2h of sleep each night but that’s how I do to get out of a shitty sleep period."

4725,hao84h8,,,insomnia,1630151788,"Yeah mine started at the beginning of 2020. Might've been the initial lockdown of the pandemic that triggered it, not sure. But the next few months it was pretty much complete isolation, sleep schedule went to trash, mental health along with it. I used to have the most beautiful, perfect sleep, never waking up once or having dreams. My insomnia started like yours, started having 12 hour sleep days but wake up feeling unrefreshed, started waking up many times (don't have apnea) and dreaming more often towards the end of my sleep cycle - heard that it was a marker of light sleep. Progressed to having difficulty falling asleep and no sleep drive (with some accompanying anxiety about it). Now I fall asleep fine but only have about 5-6 hours of decent sleep, no matter how long I was awake prior to that.

I also have chronic ongoing health problems that was misdiagnosed, treated with chemo then misdiagnosed again. Just been dealing with really deep fatigue for awhile which is a vicious cycle because I've been trying to exercise. Exertion seems to make my health problems progress more rapidly. 

Just feels like my sleep deprivation has been accumulating where now I can only charge my ""battery"" up to 20% and then it empties shortly after I wake and the whole day is a struggle. I had deferred a full year of grants/study for my graduate degree already and just had to defer another semester, pretty sure this is the last time I get to do that. Like I started school orientation (like 5 hours of work a day, not too much at all) already and had to drop out shortly after because there is no way I'd survive through a full semester like this.

I don't have depression when I sleep apart from one time I took Xanax and was a zombie for two days after. Great sleep but was disassociated and drowsy and couldn't process some colors or visual things.

Thanks for reading my sob story lol, let's try to help each other. Have you tried trazodone or an SSRI? Sometimes melatonin &amp; a small dose of trazodone works for me but I'm wary of becoming too dependent on medicine."

What bugs me most is that I don't get to reach my full potential.  I could do so much more and be more productive.  As it is, I can't really maintain a full time job.  Doing any kind of repetitive task or anything boring for hours at a time is absolute hell--just fighting through exhaustion and boredom is some kind of torture.  I have found that I can still play sports, however strange that sounds--it keeps me moving and I love a little competition.  Its impossible to get bored and tired while playing.  Pickleball has been my obsession lately and has done wonders for my mental and physical health."

4736,hanxz2r,,,insomnia,1630143985,"Andrew Huberman recently did a podcast episode explaining that omega 3's have an anti-inflammatory role and are important in ensuring that tryptophan converts to serotonin since tryptophan can also be converted into a neurotoxin. It was incredibly good timing when I was listening to him talk about that because I just basically cured my chronic insomnia (I fall asleep easily when I first go to bed, but struggle to fall back asleep if I wake up in the middle of the night and that used to happen often) when I began taking tart cherry concentrate, which contains a bit of melatonin, a bit of tryptophan, and reduces inflammation. Insomnia and inflammation seem to perpetuate each other, so tackling the inflammation and getting dietary omega 3's seems like a good strategy. It's working for me, at least."

Wednesday and Thursday I had manic levels of energy and creativity. Yesterday was actually the best day at work I’ve ever had at any job ever. No shit, a real career high point.

Got about 12k steps in yesterday. Was exhausted but preformed for the day. Figured my body would just quit on me last night and I’d get 6-7 hours. 2 am comes around and the regretted not taking one of my wife’s pills earlier In the evening to get some sleep. The dark thoughts came sometime around 1 last night wondering how long this would last and if I could do something drastic like continually holding my breath for as long as possible to pass out or something. I think I might of got about 3 hours spaced out over the whole night.

This morning as I was getting ready for work, everything was foggy and I was moving pretty slowly. I started screaming into a towel while my wife was putting her makeup on. The big boss and one of her minions stopped by to early in the work day and I had this nagging feeling they were checking in on me. 

Anyway, but if a long rant. How I made it through the day… a quad latter for breakfast, 2 monsters the first hour I was at work, Diet Coke and hour later, large Diet Coke for lunch, and for the afternoon I just sort of phoned everything in, because I didn’t want to be to wired when I got home. Felt tremors and was on the verge of a complete mental breakdown for most of the time I was by myself today. Got home and after some trouble breathing I got a solid 30 minutes of sleep. Go me! I can already tell it’s gonna be similar tonight. Thank god I have the weekend off… not that I am gonna get much sleep. 

TL/DR massive amounts of caffeine and a fake smile will get you through the day."

4797,hamid4w,,,insomnia,1630110088,Yes from experience. Not alcohol withdrawals because I mainly stuck to beer. If I was like 3 beers in and it was 9 pm I would need to go to the gas station or store to pick up more beer to make sure I could drink until I passed out.
4798,hamhnmb,,,insomnia,1630109746,"Thanks. :) My insomnia isn't too bad. I can fall asleep naturally. Some times it just takes a very long time.

Sorry to hear it didn't work for you. I suggest trying a supplement cocktail with magnesium L-threonate, Apigenin and Theanine. It's recommended by Professor Andrew Huberman - Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford University.

That one does help for me, but I'm on a stressful sheldue this week. So Ambien it is! Lol

Listen to Joe Rogan podcast episode #1683 to hear what Professor A has to say.

You shiuld follow JR podcast if you don't already. It's a gold mine for health and science. Also has space stuff and psychedelics like magic mushrooms."

4803,hamex54,,,insomnia,1630108399,"7 days is the average prescription time so its unlikely to cause physical withdrawal although everyone is different. 

The bigger issue with a short course is psychological addiction. You know it works. Next time your insomnia gets bad, you'll want to reach for the magic pills. 

When my doctor put me on it, it was for 10 days and she recommended practising good sleep hygiene, going to bed every night at the same time and tapering off. So every night for like 5 nights then every other night til they run out."

4809,ham8pw4,,,insomnia,1630105400,"No but I should say that I got to a lower dose in a roundabout way. I initially did just slowly taper from 300mg to 150mg by cutting my dose by a tiny amount each night but I couldn’t get lower than 150mg for awhile. Then I had to take prescription painkillers for awhile following a car accident and I wasn’t having as much trouble sleeping because of that so I needed less seroquel. Then following the painkillers, I found the first medication that helped my depression after failing on most typical antidepressants. Once I stopped being majority depressed, my insomnia really cleared up and that’s when I was able to cut my dose to where it is now. I forgot my seroquel at home a few weeks ago when I went out of town for week and I was actually able to sleep pretty well without it."

Also, raising the head of the bed up a few inches.  In the hospital I think it might be 45° but even 30° could help, bc its helps with the physics of the eyes wanting to be puffy after you've been lying too flat.

Also temp control and good air will help most ppl, like most ppl find they can sleep better when the room is slightly cool (not too cold, that can keep you awake if the temp is too low) and even adding a humidifier or vaporizer -- im not sure which term is correct, it may be both of them but the pharmacist at the drug store can tell you..

One last thing, and I didnt think this would work, but it does - !  A few years ago a common brand of makeup or skin care like (loreal or fructis?) came out with this little thingy that was like a pencil or stick with a roll-top lid for gliding it on (like deodorant, just a tiny wand though) ...  The magic ingredient in it was caffeine.  I dont know if they still make it but it was a sort of lime-green tube/stick thing, and now there are other similar products with caffeine for eyes.  Definitely don't get it IN your eyes though, that'd be bad.  Just dab it around the eyes and lightly massage it in.  Oh, and also cold compresses, I have one of those eye masks with a band around it to stay on, it has that gel with the tiny little blue bubbles, I keep it in fridge or freezer.  I hope some of these ideas will do some good, and a lot of better learn to cope with it eventually.  The nights where you don't sleep truly so suck though.  Always at the least get an hour or two of lying down, just for your physical body's sake.  Your mind needs the rest as well as your body, like your back, your muscles in general, etc"

More carbohydrates at dinner time can help increase sleep pressure. So one approach could be a low-carb breakfast &amp; lunch, medium-carb dinner. On the exercise front, this can remain moderate until your sleep improves - the important thing is that you stick with it.

4922,hak6k8w,,,insomnia,1630074465,"Sorry to hear about your woes, I know the cycle all too well, no sleep, feel exhausted to workout, eat more etc.
Simplest solution for now that I see is just accept you got a shitty sleep. So now what? You need to ultimately make your body physically tired, while doing steady state cardio, get some plain black coffee in you, grab some MCT oil and stir in in your coffee for the extra healthy fat your body needs, and start off with a 20 minute walk. Do this every morning without fail. Regardless of how bad you slept. Doing that alone will freshen your spirit while slowly burning calories.
I do intermittent fasting, so with my coffee and MCT oil, I normally eat around 1-2. Last meal around 8-9ish. Cut down on carbs and fill your self with healthy fats, meat and veggies. Do this alone for 2 weeks and you'll start noticing a difference in your body and energy, hell even a week you'll feel it. Forget sleep for now, your days are going to suck for a while but it's better than wallowing.

Do not hesitate to use a CPAP. I know others who thought it would be a pain, but then hearing about their great sleep I wish I had apnea so I could at least find a solution to my insomnia. I rely on meds a lot to help me function, supplements, magnesium, valerian, melatonin etc.

Have this solid goal in mind, write it down so you see it every day. Or a reminder on your phone. Track your meals on MyFitnessPal. Fill up on protein fat and veggies. The fat will keep you satiated way longer than carbs, since reducing my wheat and rice carbs to bare minimum, the weight is just melting off, but those first few days where you really don't want to do anything but think about sleep, start off with the coffee, MCT or coconut oil coffee and get walking every morning. Even if it's 10 min, slowly increase to 15, 20 etc etc. It's a one day at a time battle, and all you have is today. Good luck you. Look into r/loseit, r/keto for some ideas. Seems like the main focus is your weight disturbing not only your body, but your outlook on life and mood. I know it did for me. Zero booze either. It doesn't help one bit. And talk to your doctor. There are studies you can take home to test if you have apnea, then proceed. You got this."

I don't understand what you mean by ""I deliberately expelled menta/psychological issues"" and ""nerve networks must be equivalent to changes in perception, as GRT says that space and time rare structurally indistinguishable.""

That was just not to drift off to psychoanalytics. That stuff can get pretty esoteric pretty quickly.

Sure, actively thinking about it can cause fear conditioning.

Nontheless, given that sleep loss itself - with the immune compromising it delivers - could contribute to 1 and 3.

&gt;Yet again, this still doesn't work on chronic insomniacs. I know many people where stuff just genuinely doesn't work for them. I also know people who didn't realise they were insomniacs their entire lives, and lived without qualms for their poor sleep getting frequently interrupted and poor sleep every night. The latter group didn't stress over their insomnia and could avoid the vicious cycle of ""stress causing insomnia &gt; insomnia causing stress &gt; repeat"".

Then that would be the similar suspected mechanism behind tinnitus.

However, if the fear component gets too out of hand to function normally, aren't we already at the stage of disorder? Doesn't that imply a necessary causal precondition?

Though that's only barely true and can get very complex very quickly with the respective neurology...

I'm not yet on the level of understanding these feedbacks, I know that body-endogenous feedbacks do exist (i.e. pyruvate /Krebs cycle and ATP resynthesis, FSH and testosterone...), pinpointing what exactly could be going on, nope...

&gt;But I don't believe your three main points are the main causes for standard sleep maintenance issues. They seem too specific for an issue that affects the broader public. Taking melatonin You've boiled it down to the effect of stress hormones (cortisol and serotonin with the latter being part of histamine's ability to wake someone) on melatonin levels. But if that's so, you could easily take medication to supplement those relevant hormones and you would theoretically be fine? Take more melatonin, take antihistamine, reduce sources of stress in your life, etc.

As said, that was what I picked up going through various health clinics articles.

It would need further elaboration on wether these actual mechanisms are in such a wide range in effect."
4927,hak5bke,,,insomnia,1630073952,"You don't have it. I'm currently running on 4/5hrs broken up sleep since August 4th. I've crashed twice. Once August 8 for 9 hours (broken) and once August 18th (7hrs broken). I'm going to sleep at 8/9am every morning and waking up by noon. I feel dizzy. Eyes sore. Body heavy. And this fucking pressure in my head. But one thing I know is that I've been an insomniac for the past 5 years (remember the exact night that started it all). I've been through Literally EVERY sleep forum. Even as far as forums from the early 2000s and every  chronic insomniac goes thru the same fear at first. Yes so did I. 

Things is, insomnia is one of the last symptoms that manifest in the disease. You'll know something is up way before. So just fuck it, you know. Something that helps me in times like this is accepting the worst outcome: death. Embracing your mortality. Acknowledging that you will one day cease to exist and no longer be conscious.  Embrace that. Make peace with that because no pain lasts a thousand years. Usually when I make peace with death, all my issues become too small to care, even if I'm suffering. Going thru it now for the millionth time. Wish you rest."
4928,hak53ij,,,insomnia,1630073858,"Yes I highly agree. I remember lying in bed with both arms completely numb due to  cubital tunnel syndrome that I never got treated.

Weak grip strength in my left hand because I punched a wall and fractured my knuckle, without ever treating it properly. Starving because I lie in bed 8 hours every day doing nothing. Lonely in my destructive thoughts.

But then I honestly just took a look at my life. Am I seriously gonna let things end here? Like, am I gonna lose my dreams to a numb fucking arm and some other minor issues? That my body feels fragile? Helllll no.

That night of realisation, I took my phone and had a hot shower a 3AM. My phone fell into the water somehow 10 minutes after laying it against the wall, and the speakers immediately broke. Instead of getting angry, I just took another look at my life and thought how crazy things are like ""God you are one damn sadist"".

4980,haj4m21,,,insomnia,1630050851,"Yeah I relate to this alot right now.

I've had bad insomnia my whole life, due to ADHD and restless leg syndrome, C-PTSD and other issues (sorta self medicated with grams of Caffeine daily, all the time).

Then I essentially got treated with Amphetamine for my ADHD towards the end of 9th grade, and my sleep was improved beyond what seemed possible and I stopped caffeine. Which is funny asf, to think Amphetamine improves me sleep so much but it really, really does.

But the past 2 years, I went through a lot of things, depression and all and actually stopped taking my ADHD medication, not out of tolerance break but I gave up on life tbh, and I sleep worse because of my ADHD (I essentially never slept during my childhood, but could just go forever without sleep until I basically just blacked out of exhaustion) also sleep deprivation makes ADHD worse including making you more hyper, which also makes you unable to sleep more and more. And I had a lot of issues, with intense school work load, family and friends that died and tons of stress and everything. To the point where there's just been so many times, that I've been forced essentially to go 36 hours + no sleep, like seriously medical emergencies and shit, out of my control + an absurd work load and everything. And what makes it worse, is that my ADHD meds we're ironically the thing that improved my sleep so much, but the thing is, is that if your sleep deprived, and the more you are, the less ADHD stimulant meds work at all. and they become useless until you get sleep again, but the catch 22 is that, when I stopped taking my medication, I don't typical withdrawal, I don't get like normal fatigue and sleep too much, I just get very bad hyperactivity that makes sleep less and less possible, and also makes me do some stupid ass shit which makes things worse, but the thing is, is I can't take my ADHD meds because they won't help because they won't work, so it's pointless, and they won't work because I'm sleep deprived, and I'm sleep deprived for 1,000 reasons and one of them is my circadian rhythm is fucked, and the only way to actually reset it, is strong short term sedatives the my doctor is literally just against like period. So I'm pretty fucked because I'm so sleep deprived, that even if I do it all perfectly to the best of my ability, it doesn't matter my body will release too much cortisol and all that I won't be able to sleep regardless because of the insomnia itself, and this has been like a thing at varied intensity for almost 2 years, plus i was extremely depressed so my meds didn't really work and I couldn't sleep because I was depressed.

And so now it's at such an absurdly bad pinnacle, that my body like keeps trying to force me to go like 48+ at minimal, total sleep deprivation, mind you, I'm also just usually not taking any of my dextro-amphetamine medication for like days on end, so you would expect for me to be fatigued and that to force me to sleep right? Aha, no, because for whatever reason, my brain is basically intrinsically almost on amphetamine to begin with, because of my ADHD, and amphetamine is the thing that makes me seem normal, as funny as it is, but for amphetamine to work correctly, you can't be sleep deprived. And when I do eventually fall asleep, It's like at like 5 AM or somewhat, and I wake up at like 3 pm-7 pm, and sometimes it's such a shit quality of sleep that I wake up during sometimes and shit or I can't even tell if I actually slept or not. And OTC sleep aids aren't possible for me, because I have very bad Restless Leg Syndrome comorbid to my ADHD, so literally a melatonin, Diphenhydramine and Doxylamine succinate are not only neurotoxic on their own (the last 2 can cause dementia), if I take them my RLS will not let me sleep at all, even if I have so much brain damage I can't remember it, it will essentially force me to do an unconsensual 3 am Mauy Thai Session, AKA it wakes me up kicking even if I somehow fell asleep. And Cyclobenzaprine, which is also anticholinergic and worsens it as well, but it's also I'm so stressed and shit, that I clench my teeth in my sleep also because I have TMJ and a messed up bite to begin with, and I can literally dislocate my jaw in my sleep and I'm already in a lot of pain about 24/7 from scoliosis and other shit. 

And I know my doctor is literally like Anti-sedative period, like even Ambien or Lunesta, not just against benzos or barbs, like legit everything, and I mean, I only really want a fucking sedative for like short-term like maybe 2 weeks at the max, so I can reset my circadian rhythm, my body can stop releasing a absurd amount of stress hormones and neurotransmitters because it currently thinks it must be in the Vietnam war at the given moment, and I can eventually start taking my ADHD medication again because it will work again, because now it'd be pointless to take it. I'm not so retarded that I think I could just take high dosages of Diazepam or whatever daily for 3 years, without severe consequences and just not changing my behaviors. But I do know that sleep deprivation very easily causes, permanent, severe irreversible brain damage, that causes dementia and much more, and even one hour of sleep deprivation takes a lot to recover from, and I'm talking FAR FAR MORE, so resetting my shit so I could do something about it would be justified, because that's the purpose of those drugs to begin with. And I'm not going to take it with ADHD stims, because wtf would be the point? and I'm not really taking my meds bc they wont work because of the sleep deprivation to begin with. And I already had a lot of brain damage prior to this shit. And switching doctors, well my appointment to switch is November 8th, so I'll probably actually already have early onset dementia and psychosis by that point.

So basically, it's like I'm given a choice between early onset dementia, or having early onset dementia, or self medicating illegally, which has alot of risks, or waiting for a hopeful chance to do something, that will slow essentially the dementia because it's basically 100% guaranteed by now, the question is slowing it and the severity, at which I also virtually have fucking no control over, and the earliest chance seems to be November 8th, and it should have been months ago when I tried to explain to my doctor the issue, so basically my options are actually. 

A. Dementia

B. Dementia  

C. Illegal activity that could jeopardize potential ADHD treatment amongst other risk factors, so it might as well be Dementia

D. Dementia, but maybe something can be down months form now, so probably actually just the same as the rest. 

E. All of the above. 

And I've already tried everything under the sun other wise. To the point, that I might just actually be stupid and to blame for not going with C at  this point. But I'm virtually beyond fucked regardless. So. Dementia. Maybe I'll get like shot or something hopefully prior to the onset."

Titration up to 75 didn’t result in much better sleep just more side effects, going to 100 was def too much side effects next day.  You can only experiment, the dose for sedation is between 50-100mg, going higher than 100mg will result in the med working on different receptors and no longer sedating at higher doses. 

This said, if your not taking with a little food try that (it favors dietary fat for better absorption).  It’s got a hypnotic component to it, take it and get into bed and try to relax and don’t overthink or worry if the med will work or not, etc.  

There’s a possibility this med just won’t work as I see anecdotally from many users who report it doesn’t do crap for them.  It was truly helpful for me, my only downfall was I should have taken breaks off it periodically… this is just my own personal anecdotal experience so if it doesn’t work don’t force it, try a different med."

Here's WHAT YOU ONLY JUST RESCENTLYNSAID IN A DIFFERENT POST IN r/insomnia!!!!

""in 1990, I was started on Xanax. ""

""After many years it wasn't as effective as it was years before. ""


In 2009, Ambien was added and it along with the Xanax was very effective for years. In 2016, I required another adjustment. Low dose Seroquel was added to the mix. At the same time, my doctor switch the Xanax to its cousin, Clonazepam. ""

DO STATED THE EXACT OPPOSITE in this forum! Benzos were raised and became effective for you TIME AFTER TIME!!!  ARE you a pathological liar or just an old head who doesn't understand how advising medication is immoral and causes more harm than you think.

You’re 15 so a couple points.  You’re mom needs to be educated.  A doctor can prescribe meds that are effective for sleep short term that aren’t benzos.  There’s discontinuation syndrome no matter the drug you choose.  We take meds that alter our brains chemistry, but when taken short term and tapering gradually will result in less rebound insomnia and potential withdrawals.  

I see the words already suffered addiction is super alarming.  What have you been taking at only 15?  The fact you’re willing to buy knock off benzos is a red flag.  

The other is, there’s a 69 year old giving advice to a 15 year old minor is just wrong.  The whole you’ll be fine, go ahead a take it, do as I do and throw out every caution and supervision needed by a doctor.  

You’re head strong and going to do what you’re going to, just be very aware once you go down the nightly use, the point of return of your sleep won’t be as easy as you think.  

I’ll say this again, there’s better alternatives, have your mom go in with you to a doctors appointment and get educated and be put on a better alternative and be managed by a doctor."

The plan is to get my primary care doctor (who has been helping me experiment to see what works) and my psychiatrist to prescribe 2 different medications that I haven’t tried yet so that I will find out what works for me faster. Once I find the one, all I do is shoot my psych a message and he’ll prescribe it for me."
5057,hahs756,,,insomnia,1630023305,"Unfortunately, i don't think i could talk to a doctor.

I can't get this anxiety out of my head, i can't also sleep since i have a fear of dying in sleep."
5058,hahr5oi,,,insomnia,1630022808,It’s a type of insomnia if you wake up every few hours. If you think you might have sleep apnea you should talk to your doctor.
5059,hahq9wu,,,insomnia,1630022398,Yep. I was the same way. Because of insomnia I had terrible anxiety if I stopped drinking I didn't wanna be hungover.

I'm pretty sure dying in my sleep is the least of my concerns and doesn't really contribute to my lack of sleep, nor has it ever. I think dying in my sleep would be pretty peaceful, actually.

5065,hahn3hc,,,insomnia,1630020898,"Personally, it did for me, it was like a mild hangover/sedated feeling which wore off towards midday/late afternoon.

A friend of mine was having more fatigue than me, he would drop things at work, make mistakes etc due to the drowsiness the day after. 

It also increases your appetite so you're at risk of gaining weight - at least this was my opinion. 

If you don't mind me asking, what was it prescribed for? I know if you have sleep issues Mirtazapine is the preferred choice due to its sedative effects. If it's sleep issues you're concerned about, a regular SSRI with some proper sleep hygiene, a short term course of melatonin or beta-blocker and some sleep therapy would be better in my opinion, although I appreciate this might not be accessible."
5066,hahjozy,,,insomnia,1630019323,I’m in exactly the same place. Mirtazapine saved my life. It combined with a small dose of Xanax let me sleep when nothing else on earth would (and I had tried everything else) .
5067,hahj1sh,,,insomnia,1630019027,"So, I've been on mirtazapine for years. Initially I took a full 15 mg pill nightly. It was very effective for sleep, but my eating was out of control and I started gaining weight. This is a pretty common side effect. I decided to see if I really needed the full 15 mg so I asked my psychiatrist for a 7.5 mg prescription (the smallest one they do) and bought a pill cutter. For me 1/2 or 1/3 of the 7.5 mg pill is good enough to sleep. Then I realized I could take it every other night without too much trouble sleeping. With that regimen I had no weight gain or drowsiness the next day.

Recently I stopped taking it regularly, and take a small dose only when my anxiety is acting up. Now I do get a pretty significant ""hang over"" with drowsiness the next day. You really need to try it for yourself since everyone is different, but my experience is that drowsiness is not a problem when you're taking it regularly."
5068,hahhhbh,,,insomnia,1630018315,Be happy you're not dying? Are you sure YOU have insomnia?
5069,hahh8sf,,,insomnia,1630018207,"I started taking 15mv of mirtazapine and 0.5mg of Xanax several years ago. I've since removed the Xanax (an extremely difficult and lengthy process) but am still taking the mirtazapine. The combination of those two in doses that small is very beneficial, but even just the mirtazapine provides me a significant improvement to my quality of sleep and life. It's hard to wake up sometimes but I feel decent during the day.

Exercise, nutrition, and doing enough work during the day to be worn out at night are very important."

Your going to have to continue increasing its dose to feel the same effects. Not to mention it's withdrawl is horrible.

It hurt so bad, I'm surprised my head didn't explode some days. My vision often wasn't right right away, almost seeming kaleidoscopic. The stomach pain I felt was by far the worst part, though.

Good chance your secondary insomnia from pain morphed into primary insomnia that has far less of a legit med basis.  Instead, the most common causes are some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about the idea of sleep.

You might benefit from use of a full CBT sleep training system.  That includes the sleep hygiene ideas you described, which are important, and much  more -- including cognitive restructuring, which enables you to battle back those persistent negative sleep thoughts."

Once you go a few nights with this part of the program you'll understand what I mean. For a lot of people sleep restriction/sleep deprivation is torturous and highly anxiety provoking. More anxiety is the last thing you need when trying to improve your sleep. If you think about it, it doesn't even make any logical sense. However, if you are strongly compelled to give it a go, go for it...."

Once I was put on the correct medications my life completely changed. My life was spiraling out of control due to insomnia before the meds. Since the meds I've been consistently sleeping, had a successful career and a happy life.

What country are you in? Are they restrictive with medications? Could you sign your into a psych unit due to insomnia? If so they will try a lot of different medications to help you sleep. That's how they found what works for me. If I hadn't gone into the hospital and gotten on meds I would be living on the street today...I'm serious."

Also, talk to someone high up at work and tell them the news you've received and that it is currently impacting your sleep. Any normal human will understand this situation and have compassion. This may put your concern about losing your job to rest. Keep in mind that although you have this mutation, it does not necessarily mean that you are definitely going to get ALS or dementia.

When I used to try to fight to get more sleep, the time I did sleep kept getting less. When I accepted that I’ll have bad nights, my sleep started improving because I stopped getting stressed from worrying about sleep.

I also take sleep aid but it is every other night. On the nights I don’t take it, it usually takes me longer to fall asleep. However, the number of awakenings are almost the same as when I take sleep aid when it used to be so much more.

I have Guy Meadows’ book. I’ll have to go through it again and practice more on mindfulness and meditation throughout the day. I’ll have to look into supplements and see which ones might help.

And that is true about being able to talk to others about insomnia. Found out other people are struggling with sleep and we can help and support each other.

It doesn’t matter if you start with a low dose. Within 3-7 days that dose will no longer work, which means you’ll either have to take more, or deal with another night of worsened insomnia. You might think, ‘well at least I’ll get sleep’ you’d be right, but you will without a doubt be regretting that decision when you’re suffering from rebound anxiety during the day and risk going into life threatening withdrawal if you don’t take your night time dose.

I know it seems like no big deal because your friend is doing it but these pills affect everyone differently. I know my friend takes 1mg lorazepam every second day for months and it works great for her. I take 1mg maybe once or twice in one month and I don’t feel a thing.

But that's an antidepressant and can cause a whole bunch of nasty side effects. You could ask for a z drug (like zopiclone) but only take them on nights were you have exams the next day. 

It's something you really need to discuss with your doctor but considering you're so young, they're probably only going to suggest melatonin and develop a better sleep routine."

I have exams coming up that are extremely important (arguably the most important of my life) and I cannot mess them up. It would probably be for around 6-7 months.

5223,hacyode,,,insomnia,1629935603,"How long would you require medication is the question. 

I remember being very stubborn towards sleeping medications years ago. My doctor prescribed me some (zopiclone) because I was having a hard time falling asleep when I had to get up early for a work term. The work term was only 6 weeks (probably only 4 weeks when I finally went to my doctor) and I could sleep fine when I didn't have to wake up early (like on the weekend), but when I did I would be up till 2-4am. 

My doctor gave me those to get through the rest of the work term. But I was absolutely against it so I suffered through.  Looking back I should have just took them, would have made those weeks soooooooo much easier for myself. But years later when I developed bad sleep anxiety I finally started taking them. I shortly became too depended on them and kept taking them more often for longer periods of time. This year I took one every single night for about 7-8 months and it completely bit me in the ass. They stopped working and not I have to suffer withdrawals.

My point is if you only need them for a short period of time, then take them. But be VERY VERY careful afterwards. Even years later you could develop a mindset similar to mine where you think ""Ahhh one more night won't hurt"". It seemed like every year I would become more and more relaxed towards taking them."
5224,hacxqtf,,,insomnia,1629935172,Yeah its about every day. Even the days where I'm able to catch some sleep I constantly wake up throughout the night.

Specifically regarding sleep stress, you can use cognitive restructuring, one of the core methods in a CBT sleep training program to counter and control it.  Use of a full CBT program could allow you to eventually restore normal sleep permanently and without the use of any substances."

5255,hac1211,,,insomnia,1629921280,"&gt;Sorry, long post. I missed seeing my little sister off to college today because my body refused to sleep last night even though I was exhausted, and I tried to just stay up through the morning but I fell asleep at some point but I don’t even remember lying down. I set a bunch of alarms on multiple devices just in case but I don’t remember any of them going off either. My whole family is absolutely furious with me and I feel like such a piece of shit. Everyone including my therapist thinks that I’m choosing to be this way or I’m just lazy but it’s not true, I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. When I do sleep it’s only in short bursts and I get little to no REM, and it’s breaking me down mentally and nobody is taking me seriously when I try to seek help.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;This has been an issue since I was in elementary school and my relationships have suffered greatly as has my ability to hold a job. When I sleep during the day it’s because I need to take sleep where I can get it or else I lose all ability to function, and people see that and label me a lazy asshole who contributes nothing to society and maybe they’re right. I would give anything to be able to hold a regular sleep schedule, to fall asleep at 10 pm and be one of those productive morning people that society praises but I can’t do it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I feel so worthless and helpless and like I don’t deserve to have a good life. I’m almost 30 and I’ll probably never have a fulfilling career and I don’t even want to try for one because I know I’ll just sleep through important stuff when my body shuts down from lack of sleep. I’ve seen so many doctors and they just tell me to take melatonin and exercise, as if I haven’t been trying that for over a decade. I don’t touch caffeine ever, not even soda. Trazodone worked at a high dose but I can’t get that anymore either. Everyone thinks I’m a loser who sleeps 14 hours a night and just doesn’t feel like getting up on time and they don’t listen when I say I’m not asleep when they are because I can’t just choose to sleep like they seem to be able to.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I’m humiliated and scared and I feel so alone and worthless. Society will always look down on me as long as I’m like this. I’ll never accomplish anything in my life I don’t see the point of living if I have to live like this.

5256,hac0fw7,,,insomnia,1629921039,It doesn't work
5257,habwm6c,,,insomnia,1629919525,[deleted]
5258,habwbzp,,,insomnia,1629919413,Thank you
5259,habu7sz,,,insomnia,1629918575,It's definitely worth seeing a doctor.
5260,habu0iy,,,insomnia,1629918496,"Lol. Melatonin is basically just a placebo. It only works to reset your sleep schedule, but it's not a sleep med. I doubt there's any way you can OD on it. (But don't try!)"
5261,habtoaf,,,insomnia,1629918357,"Lucid dreams are great! I love it when I have them, though it's rare. You can pretty much be superman, and do whatever you like. Well, within reason... there does appear to still be some kind of dream-physics that I'm stuck with.

The trick I usually do when I'm entering a lucid dream, is to read something twice. If it shows up as something different each time I read it, then I know I'm dreaming."
5262,habtmd6,,,insomnia,1629918336,"Yes that's a good point and even clinically sleep hygiene items have evolved. But even then, the items cae be counterproductive. For example avoiding screens and activities at night but using a bedroom lamp to read, which can emit much more lux than a properly configured screen. Or getting exposed to bright light in the morning using an alarm clock, which for someone with DSPD is likely to further delay them. The calming activities has no basis too and it just makes the user lose their time, the clinical advice to wake up and do something if you can't sleep under 30min-1h is much better.

The problem with sleep hygiene is exactly what I wrote. It's not clinically validated nor founded on controlled observations. It's a grandma recipe. It sounds fine but it's vague and it includes items that can worsen insomnia depending on the type of insomnia."
5263,habskrz,,,insomnia,1629917917,In lucid dreams you have control and you know it's not real even if you don't have control and usual you just say I'm dreaming and wake up and you'll wake up in seconds. And in lucid dreams time perception is normal (unlike normal dreams) so you won't be stuck
5264,habs8gf,,,insomnia,1629917781,Do you have any mental or physical illness that keeps you awake?
5265,habrum1,,,insomnia,1629917626,"CBT sleep training methods help correct bad sleep habits -- which you are describing -- and negative thoughts that underlie insomnia.  You can talk to a doc for that or there's much good info online.

Short of that, better to sleep in your bed, and a cool dark quiet bedroom will help you sleep better.  You can look up 'sleep hygiene' for many more ideas like this."
5266,habl23d,,,insomnia,1629914897,"To be honest it's rather the oposite. When you're just dreaming, you have 0 control of what will happen and can still experience scary things but when lucid dreaming, with some training you can change things and decide what you want to dream about. Worst case scenario, even if you dont like what you're seeing or cant do what you'd like, knowing that it's not real already makes it better and waking up from it is really easy. Lucid dreaming is something that takes a ton of mastering and practice and the first step for many people to learn is how NOT to wake up straight away after they realize they're dreaming. So most likely, should you find yourself aware that you're dreaming, you will get too excited or nervous and wake up very quickly. 
No reason to be scared, especially if you have never experienced it before."
5267,habj718,,,insomnia,1629914147,oh yes I know that almost asleep but not quite feeling... not fun at all!
5268,habga1c,,,insomnia,1629912978,Thank you for the tip on copper. I would have found that out the hard way. Im not sure if its declining estrogen or our generally dead food ( even if you eat relatively health fully) or a combo but inso.nia is a new phenom for me. I like you would like to handle it through functional food sources. It seems like much of what ails us may be due to the quite of foods we choose. Thank you again!!
5269,habeqhu,,,insomnia,1629912365,"&gt;ouldnt even get superficial during this quit.  best way I can put it is, imagine if one of the strongest opiates in the world took as much time to leave your body as weed, and you're in intense agony, vomiting, spraying shit all over the place, sweating profusely while freezing to death and not being able to speak from being in la la land for the first 10 days when someone comes in to check on you

wtf...   
yea ""just"" insomnia. i couldn't drive in that time, focus or studying. Bz cause amnesia and with them i could study better and remember more 😅  
talk to you doctor"
5270,habecpi,,,insomnia,1629912211,"Yes, at least I can still sleep. I don't know what I would do if I could only get 3 hours of sleep, you must be exhausted 😪"
5271,habe4r6,,,insomnia,1629912123,I don’t think you’ve died from a nightmare before so I think it’ll be okay.
5272,habdlbj,,,insomnia,1629911908,"Hey man....your doctors are being very unhelpful. I had to see a psychiatrist. Here are a few other meds that can work but are not as bad as the Z drugs that doctors are so afraid of prescribing:

Remeron
Gabapentin

Remeron worked great for me for about a year but then stopped during a depressive episode. I am now tapering it and planning to stop it completely within a month.

Gabapentin (had to do 900 mg at first but now am lowering to 600mg and might lower to 300mg at some point) seems to be working pretty well. Well enough for me to stop the Remeron.

I stopped taking Trazodone almost completely. Now I save it for those random nights when I can't fall asleep by 1-2 AM. It worked when I took it like that.

If gabapentin stops working at some point, I will likely start taking Trazodone. The thing about these drugs is that they work....until they don't. So it seems as though you have to cycle between them. It's not great to have to depend on something to fall asleep, but such is our lot in life."
5273,habd9wx,,,insomnia,1629911779,"I am on my third night in a row of this too. I can feel my brain starting to drift off, it’s so weird, but my body is still wide awake and so my brain never quite gets there either. I don’t know how to get my body to relax"
5274,habblpu,,,insomnia,1629911103,"I feel for you dude. At my worst I was getting 2 hours a night before working in a warehouse. My doctor prescribed me amitriptyline a night and I was waking up with hangover feeling every morning. I'm on mirtazapine, gabapentin, and amitriptyline now and I'm still up until 3:00 - 4:00 am and waking up at 7:00 -8:00 am every day."

5277,hab9xov,,,insomnia,1629910442,Ugh that was me for hours last night as well. No reason to wake up and yet just as I was about to drift off to sleep... boom. You’re awake now! Have fun suffering!

Seriously, it makes you wanna get slappy."
5279,hab8gx5,,,insomnia,1629909862,Microdosing lsd was what worked for me mine was really anxiety driven but unfortunately its still illegal
5280,hab5fzr,,,insomnia,1629908657,"that should be on the front of the insomnia reddit sub, It's funny how anxiety tricks your brain that it is the end of the world.   
Everyone I guess thinks that they are gonna die when it first happens to them"
5281,hab4a6j,,,insomnia,1629908190,"Glad to hear you found it helpful! I’ve spent countless hours trying to figure out how to cure my insomnia and treat it in my psychotherapy patients. It generally seems to not be a psyche-only sourced problem. If you find the cocktail with zinc sulfate helps you, keep in mind that zinc tends to lower copper levels in the body, and copper deficiency has another set of symptoms that go with it that are unpleasant. I want to experiment with eating just enough beef liver to replenish my copper, and maybe replace my zinc supplement with eating oysters once a day or so to get more zinc intake."
5282,hab2sh1,,,insomnia,1629907582,And what CBT is talk with a professional sleep doctor about the sleep problem?
5283,hab271i,,,insomnia,1629907341,What to do this hour before bed I sleep in living room and there is lightning from the kitchen is this bad ?
5284,hab16hn,,,insomnia,1629906933,"Biphasic sleep is a pain when you can't get the second half of your sleep! My doctor called it early waking insomnia.

Personally when I worry I won't be able to get back to sleep... I knit. It's very deeply meditative, and I often drift off mid row."
5285,haazb15,,,insomnia,1629906184,I got braces and said no treatments kinda on my own
5286,haaz2nz,,,insomnia,1629906091,Best advice will come from a dentist who examines you.
5287,haaz0ck,,,insomnia,1629906065,"Better idea -- turn off the phone about an hour before bed and keep it off until morning. 

There's better ways.  The proven substance-free methods are contained in a CBT sleep training system."

5289,haaysjj,,,insomnia,1629905976,"Use wake time as your zeitgeber, and make progressive adjustments until you hit about 85% sleep efficiency on a consistent basis.

Important also to use all the CBT sleep training methods simultaneously.  Depending on the underlying basis for your insomnia, SR alone may not be enough to do the job."
5290,haayla4,,,insomnia,1629905895,"We actually sleep in 4 to 6 cycles of more like 90 minutes, though each night's experience is different.  No one's cycles or body clock is exact every night.

That said, the kind of awakening you describe isn't unusual -- see 'first sleep, second sleep' for more detail.

There's a number of substance-free solutions for this, esp since the substances you're taking a proving ineffective.  The optimal methods for you will depend on the underlying basis for the sleep disruption.

For a comprehensive approach, use a full CBT sleep training system."
5291,haayh77,,,insomnia,1629905848,"I’m not sure. There’s plenty of information in CBT courses and online about it. 

I think you’re supposed to start by only staying in bed the number of hours you’re actually sleeping on average each night. So if on an average night you’re only sleeping 5 hours, then you could start by setting your schedule to 12-5 for the first week and then if that goes well you could gradually expand your time in bed. 

Anyway, do some research, don’t trust my memory."

5296,haat0z1,,,insomnia,1629903601,[removed]
5297,haaskxx,,,insomnia,1629903417,Yeah I get that all the time. My therapist said because I have PTSD and when I can actually sleep I have p vivid dreams about trauma my brain associates sleeping and dreaming with trauma and tries to make me avoid it. Addressing trauma and anxiety in therapy helps a little. Idk if you have the same situation or if there's anything you're anxious about but starting to process that might help idk.
5298,haar7wa,,,insomnia,1629902852,"I started using a CBT-i app on my phone to track sleep quality. Thats where I came across some helpful tricks to get back to sleep including paradoxical thinking, sleep restriction and Wim Hoff breathing. It doesn't always work but when it does, I'm so grateful."
5299,haaqkem,,,insomnia,1629902581,This is SO helpful. I do the magnesium citrate but was unaware of the zinc sulfate - I've used tart cherry for arthritis pain b4. Super awesome info!!
5300,haapant,,,insomnia,1629902051,Could you also send me the pdf? Although I think I know which book you’re talking about

5302,haan5vc,,,insomnia,1629901156,I had a sleep study. I worried about not sleeping but was able to sleep about five hours.
5303,haamk5e,,,insomnia,1629900899,"11-7 is 8 hours in bed. That’s not sleep restriction. 

That said, your proposed schedule will still probably be helpful — sleeping and rising at the same time every day will help your circadian rhythm."

5310,haaizxm,,,insomnia,1629899359,"&gt; That's not what sleep hygiene is. There is a clinical definition of its items, in fact there are several.

Is it possible that the definition of sleep hygiene might have evolved?  I think the media has pushed the idea of sleep hygiene as being:

* A cold, pitch black sleeping environment
* Avoiding light after sunset
* no eating close to bedtime
* calming activities before bed

all of which have research backing them up.  I'm not a huge fan of redefining existing scientific terms, but, if this is, colloquially, what 'sleep hygiene' has evolved into, and it helps the public at large adopt good practices, is that necessarily a bad thing?"

5313,haaid2j,,,insomnia,1629899083,"the post is pretty accurate, though it's from a quit a year ago, I was monitored at home, after day 10 they pulled out a calendar and marked days without sleep, my wife, who quit with me went 13 days, fell asleep,  and have about a week of 1 to 2 hours after that (mostly my fault from turning, kicking, punching pillows and vomiting) we quit in same king sized bed, in a incredibly hot room with a busted window AC in late july in West Texas.  The first sleep I got was on day 19, around noon and slept until a little after 2.  Next day 9pm to 2am, then no sleep the next day, then 10am to 5pm (I felt much better at this point, was eating solid food again), then pretty much sleeping 5 to 8 hours a day after that with some all nights once i got back to home state."

5323,haa9use,,,insomnia,1629894995,There isn’t always a true reason for insomnia. A lot of the it has to do with the lives we live today and a lot of people can’t just change their circumstances
5324,haa9n9i,,,insomnia,1629894884,I've tried it and found it to be pretty useless.  I have never felt any discernable effect of it at all.
5325,haa5sj3,,,insomnia,1629892712,"How about eating later in the evening? Maybe you won't wake up to eat?

Anyhow 80% of my insomnia was caused by not eating enough during the evening or night. I aim to eat 60% of my calories after 7pm. Typically I eat a second warm meal (comparable to lunch) around 8pm, sometimes a bit earlier and sometimes later. Then I eat right before going to sleep or like 1 hour earlier, maybe like 300kcal or more depending what I ate previously or how active I was. 

I've noticed different foods have different properties regarding my sleep when I eat in the evening or night. Low fat and high protein does not really promote sleep for me, so what I do is go low fat, high carb, high protein. Or just high carb, pretty low protein. Usually combined with vegetables etc low calorie but high volume food. 

This works for me, fixed 80% of my insomnia problems straight away. I can't fall asleep if I'm hungry and I will definitively wake up if I have my calories early in the day."
5326,haa3s91,,,insomnia,1629891482,"Thanks for the input. For most of my life I have had a very limited sugar intake, and have always eaten lots of vegetables and protein as part of my regular diet, so I strongly believe I need bigger solutions."
5327,haa31z5,,,insomnia,1629891014,"Yep, ask your doc for a strong sleep medication.  My insurance needed 6 hours of recorded data rather I slept or not to pay for it, I only slept 150 mins and had to lay there the rest of that time.  It was enough supposedly to rule out apnea, parasomnias, etc."
5328,haa0hgx,,,insomnia,1629889268,basically instead of me trying to fight away my thoughts and fake it all day I just  gave in and let them overtake me. Once you learn you aren't your thoughts most of the power they had went away.  Took alot of exposure therapy and it does take awhile to figure it out but meditation is good for anyone. Not a better time to start then today. And i take 75mg seroquel daily about an hr before i go to bed and im out  no problem. Most doctors will prescribe it to you with little fuss as it isn't a narcotic. If your serious about learning more on mindfulness go check out the r/mindfulness sub.

5335,ha9x9rx,,,insomnia,1629886828,"No matter how difficult, try only natural means of falling asleep. Your body will get dependent on whatever you're taking and eventually becomes resistant to it. Then you'll have to find a stronger substance..

Tonight I tried getting out of bed instead of laying here flopping around.  I read for about 30 mins in another room and tried again to fall asleep.  It took me another 40 mins to fall asleep unfortunately.

I just ordered some earplugs and I’m going to give them a try.  I’m hoping if I don’t wake up from any noise I’ll just stay asleep…"

5344,ha9uk25,,,insomnia,1629884591,"Medication trials are exhausting and I can understand not wanting to trial them again. I just got an accurate mental health medication and though now it’s disrupting my sleep a bit it’s really making a difference for me! There are good meds that will work for you, it’s just a process to get those 😔 

You can search sleep hygiene and see if any of those coping strategies might be helpful. I’ve had intermittent success with some of them, personally when it’s a big day and I can’t sleep I’ll draw a really hot bath and soak until I’m sleepy, then bundle myself off to bed again 🤣

I hope you were able to make something of the day anyways!"

I still need a proper diagnosis and proper help.

Thank you for your comment. ♥️ I am glad I am not alone. ♥️"
5347,ha9u1iq,,,insomnia,1629884151,"1. My routine is just reading before I sleep tbh. Just anything that helps me refocus and not think too much.

2. What makes me OCD? That is a big question. I have many different themes (harm and contamination being two of them) and I often obsess over sleep and worry about it. 

3. I think this is part of my OCD. I feel a need to be asleep for a certain time, therefore I felt I did not have time to read and wind down."
5348,ha9tsqh,,,insomnia,1629883945,"I would kick the melatonin. It’s usually in much higher quantities than our bodies make and many people find they wake up a few hours after taking it.
What you might find very helpful is to begin taking tart cherry extract at bedtime. I’m a chronic insomniac who usually can’t fall back asleep after waking up, but then I settled on a “cockatiel” of tart cherry concentrate, magnesium citrate, and zinc sulfate at bedtime and it’s been great at getting me 7-8 hours of sleep consistently when nothing else could AND I can actually fall back asleep when I wake up in the middle of the night. Tart cherry is anti-inflammatory. Given our modern diets and lifestyles, as well as high stress levels, many of us have some levels of inflammation whether we can visually detect them or not. There’s also a relationship between inflammation and poor sleep, each contributing to the other. 
There was another study I had read about zinc levels being higher in those who do not struggle to sleep, and reflecting on my diet, I realized I probably needed more and added it to my bedtime mix."
5349,ha9tk0j,,,insomnia,1629883737,"Messing with the natural cycle your body is in can disrupt how deeply you sleep anyways and a new job probably is adding at least a bit more stress which does too. When I wake up and have trouble sleeping I get out of bed and do something for a bit, an hour or two usually. If I’m stressed I like music usually and Reddit or the like 🤣 

If you can try not to worry about sleeping sometimes you’ll get drowsy again! I worked many years in a 24 h facility and had all sorts of weird sleep due to a very irregular work schedule."

lorazepam has a longer half-life than some, yes, but compared to clonazapam at 18 hours your results might be different on a different benzo.

It’s never great to be on any of the drugs long term, but short courses to help you over a hump can be really good.  Lunesta is the other hypnotic and does t have nearly the side effects of ambien. 

Trazadone did zero for me after three nights. Boooo!  

It does feel like playing spin the wheel with trying to match meds to symptoms to metabolism and side effects. 

Hope you’re able to get some good results soon!!!"

5410,ha8j6s4,,,insomnia,1629854064,"I have a therapist and I'm starting DBT next week (for different reasons). Will that general DBT benefit sleep though?

Yeah ...sleep hygiene. I go to bed at the same time. Get up at the same time. Use blackout curtains. Stop all caffeine several hours before bed. Don't eat right before bed. Raise the head of the bed slightly to avoid acid reflux. Exercise when I can. Limit (but never eliminate) TV before bed, especially avoiding exciting TV, and keep what I do watch to peaceful or ""tiring"" shows like documentaries. I'm sure there's more I could do to improve...

I'm a skittish about hypnotics. I had tried ambien though, and it *did* work, day 1... but the hangover I got was *noooot* worth it!

Strange you say lorazepam is short acting...I've read it's supposed to last 6-8 hrs. Is that not true? I will say though it's been disproportionately tolerable compared to other drugs, but I would consider other benzos if I need to. I don't think my psychiatrist wants me on benzos forever though...So I really just want to find something more long term that I can take daily. I thought trazodone might be it... but it doesn't last the whole night, and causes emotional lability the next day."

5427,ha7owca,,,insomnia,1629840503,"Try CBT-i if you want. However, if you suffer from high anxiety over the sleep deprivation part of the program and it's causing you problems, read up on the ACT-i program by Dr Guy Meadows and put that program in practice. It is a more reasonable and sensible program than CBT-i and much less anxiety provoking. Dr Meadows switched his patients from CBT-i to ACT-i because most of them were not responding to CBT-i."
5428,ha7nwtt,,,insomnia,1629840086,"You probably need to try different prescription sleep medications until you find one that is effective, but has very low side effects. If not, you know that this is likely to continue, right?"
5429,ha7mzic,,,insomnia,1629839697,"It seems that it your case, not only were your specific prescription medications not effective, but also CBT-i, melatonin, working out and long walks. And, so you've come to the end of the road, but you have one last one to try; Acceptance, by working through Dr. Guy Meadows program. I will say that the ACT-i program does seem like a very promising program and Meadows does get good results. However, since the is the probably the last thing that you can try, what happens if ACT-i also does not work like everything else you've tried?

I would guess that you have not tried every available prescription medication. Perhaps you tried a couple and they didn't work so you damned all medications. If that's the case, don't give up on meds. Very often it is hit or miss with meds, but if one keeps trying everything that's available you will find the one that is truly effective for you. (Keep that in mind if ACT-i does not work for you) Having said that, I look forward to hearing your experience with ACT-i. I read; ""The Sleep Book"" by Dr Guy Meadows and it was packed with knowledge and valuable insights about sleep and insomnia. The book also contains the entire ACT-i program. ACT-i is your very best bet for a non-med approach to insomnia and I wish you good luck.

Please keep us informed as you proceed through the ACT-i program no matter if it's a positive or negative experience as we would all like to know if it is an effective treatment.

5434,ha7ih1q,,,insomnia,1629837841,My favorite is off brand unisom. Off brand things work better for me idk why. I wouldn’t recommend Tylenol pm or anything like that because Tylenol can potentially cause some kind of cancer if you have it too much and relying on it for sleep is dangerous.

Most of its sedating effects come from the H1 antihistamine and the 5HT2CA antagonism.  Antidepressants may take 4 weeks to reach optimal levels in your system.

You'd be safer asking your doc for a prescription for sleeping pills if other things like good sleep hygiene, melatonin, valerian, exercise,  etc don't work. They still carry a risk for addiction but they're well controlled unlike the sale of alcohol so less commonly abused."
5456,ha6xb55,,,insomnia,1629829443,Yes on an empty stomach. I try not to eat beforegoing to bed.
5457,ha6s6qx,,,insomnia,1629827426,"Commenting on melatonin, it's not rubbish when it comes to sleep, especially for an older person who uses it at low doses due to its hyperthermic effect on core body temperature.  Its absolutely not expensive pee, it has other benefits too, but the CT assistance helps with sleep onset latency.   Plenty of studies conducted on this."

I even did a random blinded trial, and it turned out trazadone was no better than placebo. That's just me, though. IMO, it's not a good drug for sleep, and it has some bad side effects."

5465,ha6nkrh,,,insomnia,1629825618,"Maybe try some light exercise or something physically stimulating an hour or so before you try to go to sleep to help expend some nervous energy and force your body to want to sleep in order to recover.

All alcohol is going to do is dehydrate you and ruin your quality of sleep. You'll probably wake up feeling like you didn't sleep at all if you consume enough alcohol to get drowsy."

5471,ha6jby2,,,insomnia,1629823927,"Yes for me personally I slept all night and had very little side effects. I'd just wake up feeling a little wonky for an hour or two but that was really it, and of course you'd almost never feel fully completely rested even after 6-7 hours of sleep because it interrupts sleep architecture."

Just make sure you dont take it too late, I take it at around 10 and then I get ready for bed etc and go to bed around 11. And it helps me sleep after having months of max 3 hrs per night (and at least 2 nights/week with zero hrs). Ive had insomnia on and off for 10 years but this was my worst episode of insomnia in my life.. I was prescribed zopiclone first and it didnt work for me and now im on trazodone

I can sleep now and I no longer have the initial side effects that I had on trazodone when I first started. tbh Listen to your doctor and keep taking it as they instructed , I dont think its a good idea to stop a medication without doctor supervision"

Went to a psychiatrist, combination of stress and xanax abuse caused it. Whenever I take a z-drug I sleep like a baby, without it I start sleeping at around 3 o'clock.

I'm quite sensitive so one bad night is a nightmare for me.   


Can you answer some questions on how much on avg. do you sleep a day, did you sleep anxiety, how do you go through the day when having not slept or having slept a little"

5485,ha668u7,,,insomnia,1629818570,Thanks for all your replies folks. I’ve started “why we sleep” for some basics on just what sleep is all about. Decent and fairly interesting so far.
5486,ha662f5,,,insomnia,1629818495,Wine would work better
5487,ha65lfj,,,insomnia,1629818300,Okay I need to conquer my anxiety
5488,ha64u0q,,,insomnia,1629817973,"Yes, CBT-i is definitely worth a try before resorting to long-term medication. In the OP's case, it has a good chance of working, since one of his issues is falling asleep. Anxiety?"
5489,ha64fmb,,,insomnia,1629817801,"Yes, as Morpheus said, CBT-i can work, especially if you have sleep anxiety that is causing difficulties going to sleep.

Personally, I haven't found it much help for sleep maintenance insomnia, which is waking up and not being able to get back to sleep. But even so, it's definitely worth trying. If nothing else, it gives you a better understanding of sleep."
5490,ha63mp7,,,insomnia,1629817451,"Progress, and yes you are so right about all the negativity about sleep that fuels insomnia.  We insomniacs most certainly know about the importance of sleep and don't need the constant reminders about how much we are losing because of our tossing and turning.

Hang in there."
5491,ha63f9g,,,insomnia,1629817364,"Obviously the substances aren't working.  Hopefully you sleep much better tonight, and get a handle on the reasons why."
5492,ha63a8m,,,insomnia,1629817303,"Can be many causes for this, including too much time in bed as you suspected.  You can try keeping a fixed wake time and methodically adjusting bed time until you find your sweet spot, otherwise use in-bed relaxation methods like deep breathing to help yourself fall back asleep when awakened."
5493,ha631t5,,,insomnia,1629817203,"Depends on what's causing the sleep disruption.  If you have a medical or psychiatric condition, then yes drug therapy might be one solution, especially if they are otherwise out of your ability to control.

For primary insomnia, by far the most common type, there are no identifiable underlying med or psych conditions.  Usually some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep. 

For that the standard of care is use of a CBT sleep training system, which is substance-free."
5494,ha628vu,,,insomnia,1629816857,"A small amount of alcohol can also be stimulating which results in taking more,  also alcohol has glutemate activity when it wears off .

5500,ha5we3o,,,insomnia,1629814321,"&gt; I'm waking up like 4-5 pm, and I can't sleep until like 5 am, no matter what I'm trying. 

Your circadian rhythm is shifted. It's effectively jet lag. The only way to shift back is to get up in the morning at a consistent time. In the interim this will mean reduced total sleep time as you won't have the sleep pressure to fall asleep at an earlier time; just stay up later until you can. Bright light exposure from the sun in the mornings really helps at anchoring your circadian rhythm there. More about that [here](https://insomniasos.net/), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ) video from a Stanford prof.

&gt; But yeah, maybe I should force my self to an intense exercise and hope I manage to not injury myself somehow, and tire myself out. 

It doesn't need to be intense. Moderate exercise is all you need to yield the benefits. Intense exercise can raise cortisol higher in the short-run and you need time to come down from that to relax, it's common for athletes to get insomnia symptoms after intense bouts. 

&gt;  it's really not that great for sleep

It isn't, as I suggested. It's better for sleep *onset* and pain, not sleep quality. You seemed to be complaining about both."
5501,ha5vzu2,,,insomnia,1629814144,"That’s great! I also found that meditation makes a massive difference, but like you said, you have to do it regularly or it doesn’t work as well.

5506,ha5te3t,,,insomnia,1629812965,"I'm coming up on 4 years sober. A large part of my binge drinking was because I felt if I sobered up I wouldn't be able to fall asleep and I would feel horrible. One shot isn't going to do anything, but you'll soon learn that more than one knocks you out, but you won't feel great as other comments have pointed out. And then you'll rely on that night after night. And before you know it, you'll be killing fifths or six packs to fall asleep.

Don't go down that rabbit hole, it's a product of glorification of drinking society."

5510,ha5qew9,,,insomnia,1629811565,"You are an amazing girlfriend! And as someone with chronic insomnia, and a partner, there's not much you can do rather than listen and remind him you're there. Trust me, if it hadn't been for the support I've been getting from my partner, I would have been in a much darker place now. The fact that someone actually listens and tries to understand is a life-saver."
5511,ha5q5zc,,,insomnia,1629811441," High dose Psilocybin gave me total relief from anxiety for a couple of weeks which allowed me to sleep early and soundly. Perhaps for the first time in my life I was excited to wake up early and enjoy the coming day.

But I'm loathe to recommend it because the experiance itself is unpredictable, frightening and extremely emotional. It's not an easy medicine to take and I think for long term benefits it needs to be used in a therapeutic or shamanic setting. 

 It's very hard to say how you might react to it. Microdoses didn't do much for me, the healing seems to come from the experiance itself. It would take multiple experiances and they should really be guided for safety and to ensure they are beneficial. 

 Unfortunately it remains illegal and research has been suppressed for a long time. So you'd be experimenting on yourself with it.

 If it's something you are interested in, make sure you are well informed and do what you can to mitigate the risks. It has amazing healing potential, but it's also very powerful and should be respected as such. 

 Again, I'm not going to recommend it. It helped my anxiety temporarily, it's not a magic fix. I don't know you, nor if it would help with your sleep troubles. It's really a shame there are not medical professionals who are qualified to help with this."
5512,ha5pjid,,,insomnia,1629811137,I may be the minority. My husband and I have had two drinks before bedtime for the last ten years and we rarely wake up. Is it healthy?

5526,ha5j6lf,,,insomnia,1629807817,"I have the same problem, i cant advice you about meds but you need to do things that make you feel secure and safe before going to bed.
For me its checking the door is locked, keeping multiple smal knives in my room, having a trusted person nearby and most importantly I have a electric blanket that is always maxed ( its cold here usually but even during hot times its on plus it helps with my body pain) and having a heavy blanket on me (even if I'm sweating)
You need to work out what makes you feel good and comfortable with your therapist and do it.
Could be anything at all even having a cube if chocolate before bed.

5528,ha5j1rf,,,insomnia,1629807741,OMG exactly the same 😳 you put words on the situation. I wake up with a panic attack.
5529,ha5izgc,,,insomnia,1629807706,"You have to go to bed and prepare for sleep, for zopiclone to work. I find it doesn't do anything, until I get into bed and relax for sleep. Then, it just kind of puts me to sleep before I'm even aware of anything happening. Very much like a ""normal"" person.

It takes about an hour to work, for me. I go to bed about 45 minutes after taking it, so just 15 minutes to go to sleep.

Of course, not everyone will experience the same effect. It's possible it just doesn't work for you."

5546,ha5hptg,,,insomnia,1629806980,"Yeah with no experience or tolerance that dose should have worked. try tonight taking it and just trying to sleep, no reading or playing on phone. It also works better on an empty stomach, so don't eat anything for 3 or 4 hours before. 

I find it a weird one, it works beautifully well for me and has done for a decade, but if I don't go try and sleep straight away it doesn't work as well, it's like you miss that initial effect."

5548,ha5hn79,,,insomnia,1629806937,No problem! If it means anything it seemed Seroquel fixed my sleep but I don't know if I can recommend that to people that may not have tried like trazadone or what not as it's an antipsychotic but I had no bad effects really.

5550,ha5hchs,,,insomnia,1629806759,"No, the insomnia I experienced was certainly not caused by anxiety. I was getting jolts throughout my body that prevented me from sleeping like I was constantly in a state of fight or flight with really high andreneline. Nothing in my life had changed to cause anxiety and I was happy to get the vaccine. I also never experienced insomnia like this before so it just doesn't make sense to pin it on anxiety. None of the sleep aids I tried worked I took melatonin, nyquilZZZ, antihistamines, tea, I also meditated and did some mild stretching throughout the day to relax my body and none of it seemed to help. When I would fall 'asleep' it felt like I was stuck in this semi lucid state where it felt like I was dreaming but I would remember everything. I would be woken up after 30min -1h to the smallest movements and noises with a sense of high alert. Anyways I have so much to unpack here I won't continue but sure some people have insomnia that is anxiety induced and this was not it."
5551,ha5h39q,,,insomnia,1629806607,i’m in the same boat. it’s currently 5 am where i am and i have kind of given up tonight haha. i guess it might just be resorting to alcohol that is a scary thought to me. alcohol in any regularity is not something i want anyone to feel dependent on. have you seen a doctor or tried treatment?

A lake of sleep reduce the efficacity of your immune system. And during your sleep, your brain is entirely clean of shift produced during awaking.

In short term, you will have a poor immune system.

I tried to stop intrusive thoughts, breathed deeply and tried to focus on my body rather than mind. It didn't work, so I started crying and feeling really depressed and suicidal. I found this subreddit this night and one person recommended to read one book that helped him a lot. The realisation that I'm not alone in this and reading a few pages from the book gave me relief, I went to bed and managed to fall asleep within an hour.
 I'm sure there are a lot of guidelines to follow, but if you feel desperate and want to give it a go, I can send you a PDF version of this book. It's more about acceptance and putting an end to struggles, not fighting for your sleep with meditations (even though they indeed work to calm your mind). This book is intended to be read in five weeks, we can go through this together, share our experience and help each other.

I find it so frustrating as well because I’ve had to learn how to sleep with earplugs and an eye mask. My window of sleepiness is ridiculously short. It lasts for like 5 minutes, and lying down in bed always winds me up (chronic pain, insomnia related). So listening to something in the bedroom would make such a huge difference to my sleep

5610,ha4wnmh,,,insomnia,1629790416,"Im gonna vent a little bit here and I hope that’s okay; 

I’ve been waiting for sleep cbt since the year before the pandemic. I have adhd and am unable to structure myself enough to do that myself, without a group/teacher to hold me accountable. My clinic is in disarray due to COVID budget cuts and my most recent doctor has never even worked in psychiatry before, and told me I’m smart, and because I’m smart I shouldn’t have insomnia. I should just find ways to sleep

I wanted to scream “don’t you think I’ve tried?!?!? If intelligence is all it took do you think I’d be here talking to you?!???” 

(Not to mention how rude that is also to those who don’t know the medicine lingo. Do they in his eyes deserve to have insomnia?) 

I sleep on zopiclone, melatonin, quetiapine and amitryptiline. I use an 18kg weighted blanket (all of my me weighs like 65kg), I also switch it out for a sensory blanket sometimes. I sleep with earplugs and an eye mask. I never sleep during the day (lol if I could I would). 

And still I get nights like these. Nights with semi lucid nightmares, where my brain is trying to convince me that I’m not dreaming by showing me things I know to be impossible in dreams (tonight it was remembering my dads phone number and trying to call for help. The numbers on the screen worked, but my thumb kept slipping and putting in the wrong ones).

I suspect that I might have restless leg syndrome, whenever my adhd pills aren’t in my body, my limbs itch and tingle with this feeling of electric charge. I know it’s a common side effect of neuroleptic pills but I’ve had it since before I started them, and I get it on all sleeping pills. There are medications for restless leg.

But I’ll never get them because my doctor fucking thinks if you know big science words you can’t also be sick."

No it does not build up in the system, quite the opposite; you can build tolerance

For me zopiclone is necessary to make my other pills work, but doesn’t work alone (except have me do groggy things I can’t remember the day after)

It might be the case that you need melatonin+zopiclone and perhaps another pill as well. Or a higher dose of zopiclone

(I take melatonin, zopiclone and a low dose of quetiapine or amitryptiline depending on what I need) 

If finance is an issue, zopiclone+an antihistamine is a common and very very cheap option

But I recommend taking melatonin with it"

You might benefit from a short course of lunesta to keep small things from waking you overnight to train you to stay asleep…. And stop that anxiety feedback loop.  One reason small noises are waking you could be because your anxiety is keeping you from deeper sleep stages.  So your body is staying hyper vigilant all night.  

Your current benzo is a very short acting benzo.  Calms quickly but is out of your system quickly.  A longer acting benzo overnight could also help (but not great to mix benzodiazepines and sleep meds)…"

I know exactly what you’re going through but my insomnia has been for the last 1.5 years. I was losing my mind in the truest sense. I had exploding head syndrome too, not that I know what it is specifically but I’d be woken up by an extremely loud sound seemingly from the inside of my fucking head. It feels really fucked up, icky, unjustified. Insane nightmares. I once dreamt that my mother fed my gf to me in a meat pie and I had to sit and eat it. My mother looking like a reptilian in a bath robe, giving me this look of “I’ll eat you if you don’t eat her”. I slept 1 hour per 12 hours of attempting it. Pills didn’t work, they only made me more exhausted. 

Then one day I tried self acupuncture on my feet, pressing a bic pen lid or similar on the pads of my big toes to cause some (or lots of) pain, in different spots on the pad for good measure. I slept 5 hours straight that night, for the first time in 4 months and although I still sleep in 2 hour stretches I fall asleep within a few minutes and after 2-3 of those stretches I then sleep a straight 6 hours sometimes. You want acupuncture. Especially on your big toes. Just do it. What it does is open your pineal gland, shuts your logical mind off and your imaginative mind on, and you just drift away like you once were able to. Your body is probably not sleeping for feeling like it is unsafe. The mind forgets - the body does not. Unresolved trauma goes unnoticed. Opening your pineal gland will tell your body that it is safe to sleep. It will shut off all the markers that are keeping it alert. Your body is waiting for some kind of damaging blow to it. When you cause pain to the big toes it tells the body “this is that pain that you were expecting,” and the alarms shut off."

When you have strong anxiety, your body will be in fight or flight mode which your heart starts beating faster. When you're super anxious or having panic attacks it's hard to think about else because you're focused on the physical symptoms so beta-blockers regulate the physical symptoms to allow you to deal with the anxiety.

OCD, Bipolar, and other stuff kind of trumped anxiety and the only thing I've learned about anxiety in therapy was daytime breathing techniques. Problem is key word is ""daytime"". As soon as you start focusing on something like that, even if it managed to calm the anxiety, it would awaken me with the focusing...

The key problems are twofold: 1 my sleep is garbage so it's all broken up even if I didn't have anxiety. And second the anxiety prevents the falling back to sleep afterward. I don't attribute anxiety to be the primary reason for waking up (at least not very often), it's more likely to prevent the return to sleep. Does that make sense?"

5662,ha3ss52,,,insomnia,1629766945,"Your anxiety can cause your heart to pound. Taking a beta-blocker like propranolol can ease the physical symptoms. If you're anxious in bed, I recommend getting up to do breathing exercises, hug yourself, and keep telling yourself that you're tougher than this anxiety and it shall pass. 

What benzos do you use? I used 0.5mg Xanax every night for a week and I became anxious about being dependent on it even though a week shouldn't make me addicted. 

I've been battling insomnia for over a year now and having anxiety besides sleep can make it worse for sure. Therapy can help solve some of the underlying issues. Are you currently in therapy?"

But because if dependency what dose is prescribed and worked the first month probably won't work the second unless increasing the dose. People prescribed xanax report feeling LESS anxiety/better sleep BEFORE being prescribed xanax to begin with. Smart prescribers will only reccomend staying on benzos (especially xanax with one of the shortest half lifes) for 5-8 weeks.

5667,ha3juf4,,,insomnia,1629762878,"Regarding ""no consistent medication for sleep,"" that certainly hasn't been my experience at all and there are more of us out here than you can imagine.

Would you consider a diabetic addicted to insulin? It might be better for you to think of some insomniacs being reliant on a medication instead of addicted. Or perhaps you personally have had some real addiction issues with sleep medications?

However, perhaps you are young and you did state that your insomnia goes away so while you are young, if you are, it may be best for you to try other things.

5670,ha3i4hf,,,insomnia,1629762075,"In 1990, I was started on Xanax. It was a miracle drug that enabled me to sleep very well for many years. After many years it wasn't as effective as it was many years before. In 2009, Ambien was added and it along with the Xanax was very effective for years. In 2016, I required another adjustment. Low dose Seroquel was added to the mix. At the same time, my doctor switch the Xanax to its cousin, Clonazepam. So, since 2016, I have been on Ambien, Seroquel and Clonazepam every single night. However my regimen of medication for sleep began in 1990 in which I took medication every night for sleep. In total, I am now up to over 31 years of prescription medications every single night. I started meds at age 37 and an currently 69. No regrets whatsoever. The meds allowed me to have a life."
5671,ha3gcdh,,,insomnia,1629761246,The RIGHT med for you WILL Help.
5672,ha3f163,,,insomnia,1629760645,"First, ""The Gold Standard"" for insomnia is the prescription medication, OTC medication, technique, method or ploy that effectively enables you to get the sleep that you require. There is no one size fits all in regard to the treatment of insomnia. Different things work for different people. Now that we've gotten that out of the way I'll answer your question....

During my lifetime of insomnia I have read virtually every single book published regarding insomnia. None of the books helped me in any way to manage insomnia until I read; ""The Sleep Book"" by Dr. Guy Meadows. Although this book is not long, it is packed with lots of useful information about sleep and insomnia. In addition, it includes the entire ""ACT-i Program"" which is very effective for many insomniacs. Dr. Meadows incorporated ACT-i therapy into his practice because so many of his insomniac patients were not responding to CBT-i. If you read the book and don't even practice the ACT-i program it is still very useful because it will open your mind to the truths about sleep and insomnia. You'll feel better after learning so much about sleep and insomnia. In my opinion, ACT-i is the real ""Gold Standard"" for many insomniacs because the program makes so much sense, unlike the torturous CBT-i with it's anxiety producing sleep deprivation aspect and self therapy silliness.

If you read one book, read ""The Sleep Book."" It has the greatest potential to actually help one with insomnia if one is dead set with proceeding with a non-med approach. Even if a person is managing their insomnia well with prescription medications, this book is an asset of valuable information and insights."

5681,ha3b3uu,,,insomnia,1629758880,"Let's put the Randy Gardner sleep deprivation experiment in perspective. Randy Gardner broke the record by staying awake for 11 days. After breaking the record, Gardner went back to being a normal sleeper. He never suffered from chronic insomnia for years and years therefore it's absolutely ridiculous to point to Gardner as proof that chronic long term insomnia doesn't have health consequences.  His experiment is such a minuscule amount of time compared to the average chronic insomniac that suffers for months, years and decades of their life. If Gardner had been forced to stay awake for an additional 11 days he very likely would have died. Scientists have done sleep deprivation studies on animals and ultimately they die. And, of course, most have heard of the rare human disease of Fatal Insomnia where human cannot sleep and ultimately die.

Be wary of anyone that attempts to minimize sleep deprivation. We require sleep like air, water and food. Sleep deprivation in the form of insomnia may take longer to kill compared to a lack of these but ultimately it will if allowed to go on long enough without medical treatment."

It's been a week since I've reached out to doctors, I felt so inspired and finally full of energy to deal with this problem, but now I feel like everything I was told is to take some supplements and try to relax, I feel really belittled rn, my family don't say anything, my friends are sharing some shallow tips and i take everything negatively, I feel like they don't even try to understand my problem. 
It's kinda frightening to find such a subreddit where other people say they are suffering from it FOR YEARS and I can't even put up with two months of it and I feel discouraged from any attempts to change this situation, for no matter what others have done, they didn't succeed. 
But I'm glad I read your post and I see that some people have actually found their ways to solve this problem.

&gt;Not great for sleep. If you want to go this direction, better to opt for CBD / marijuana as it can both yield pain relief and improve sleep onset. But don't rely on this too much either. You can get withdrawals and while it can help get you to sleep it may impede overall sleep quality

I'm not really taking almost any of the medications I listed, I just listed them for context and I'm pretty sure I explained that in another comment. I also explained why I can't take some of the medications and why I don't, I just listed them to give more context for my circumstance and my options. 

CBD is not even considerable, I'm against supplements, they're unregulated. Cannabis is very complex, but almost always raises blood pressure, heart rate, intraocular pressure, body temperature, amongst other things that cause problems sleeping. I ended up using a very small amount the other night, and it's really not that great for sleep, but granted I at least slept but poorly. 

Ethanol would honestly probably be the better option, in the 0.11-14% BAC level, it's just that i'm not exactly of age so it's not the best option. I also know pharmacodynamics and toxicology, and honestly, It's somewhat abysmal that ethanol is even legal given it's profile; and I don't drink by choice based on it's toxicology. But it'd be the more effective option, at least over cannabis atm.  

I should definitely exercise, the only thing is, I'm waking up like 4-5 pm, and I can't sleep until like 5 am, no matter what I'm trying. And to exercise I'd need to take ephedrine which is a fairly strong sympathetic stimulant, because other wise I get sick from asthma and can't breathe. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow, because now I have some things to attempt to do, and have a transdermal nicotine patch on atm, and I don't consume nicotine and have no tolerance to it. So exercise would cause an increase in absorption and cause the dose to be too high if I exercised right now. But yeah, maybe I should force my self to an intense exercise and hope I manage to not injury myself somehow, and tire myself out. 

I will say that at least today when I woke up, I felt a little awake a bit earlier as I woke up compared to yesterday, yesterday I woke up late, took stimulants, felt even more sleepy, didn't redose my simulants on purpose, sorta back fired as when hey wore off I got rebound ADHD hyperactivity, and I somehow became more awake on the comedown of stimulants. And I just could not tire my self the fuck out."

After therapy and working with psychiatrist What works for me is the 3 drugs I mentioned. I take one of them for 3 days in a row, that gets me into a good sleep cycle, which slowly the sleep gets worse but usually can manage 3 or 4 weeks, then I repeat the cycle with one of the other drugs so not taking the same one all the time."

5705,ha2xt02,,,insomnia,1629753134,You should try visit an endocrinology. Some unbalanced hormone levels can lead to insomnia so explaining your problems and other symptoms to an endocrinologist might send you to some blood tests so the doctor can see what is going on. If there are issues for real in your blood test the endocrinologist would put you on some meds and would actually help you get better. If the blood tests are good then is something going on psychological and you need to talk with a psychiatrist about that. That's what I've done not for insomnia but for other symptoms such as heart palpitations faster heart rate and tremors. Wish you the best.

For me nitrazepam is the best as knocks me out for 8 hours, downside is long half life so feel pretty out of it when first wake up. I wouldn't use it if had to drive first thing next day or had work. 

Diazepam works well, long half life but not as strong as nitrazepam in terms of hypnotic effects but will give me good sleep, still feel a bit groggy when wake up, although a coffee and shower wakes me up. So fine to then work, drive etc

Zopiclone also works well, not a Benzo but Z drug, acts in a similar way. Fast acting which is good and wake up feeling fairly fresh. Only issue is the aftertaste, leaves horrible metallic taste in mouth the next day, nothing gets rid of it. 

These for me are all great for sleep, however cannot use them daily as you will develop tolerance so need to update the dose and they will cause physical dependence.

Or, “my hearts beating a little fast. That’s alright, I’m happy to have a heart that works.”

I approach these thoughts, acknowledge them, and move on. I never try to cut them off or fight with them like a tug of war. And MOST importantly, I do not prepare for sleep at all. No rituals. No lights off time or refusing to use the phone in bed. 

When you eliminate all rituals, sleep-specific supplements and rules, sleep feels more natural. There is nothing you need to do to ‘prepare’ as day turns to night."

Addiction is a physical or mental craving for a substance. I don't think that normally applies to zopiclone. Benzos, sure, if they are abused. But z-drugs don't really do anything other than make someone sleepy.

There are exceptions, of course. People who have previous drug or alcohol addictions, probably shouldn't take z-drugs."

wake up at 7-9am for 9-11 hours of sleep feeling fresh as a fucken daisy.

&amp;#x200B;

i thought in my head more hrs = better rest .. so i did some reasearch and found a journal article from a scientific study from the late 1960's which analysed human deprivation of sleep- featuring 48 hr cycles with patients and varied the sleeping hrs to find the optimum time a human would need to recover from staying up throughout the night and following day

even if you firmly believe it's a consequence of solely your doing, then focus on what you can do now. insomnia is NOT an irreversible condition. even if you put it off until it got real bad, the sooner you work to better it, the better.

Not great for sleep. If you want to go this direction, better to opt for CBD / marijuana as it can both yield pain relief and improve sleep onset. But don't rely on this too much either. You can get withdrawals and while it can help get you to sleep it may impede overall sleep quality.

I take it about 50% of the time. Usually, a few weeks on, a few weeks off. Okay, when I'm on it, I usually only take it for a week, then stop for 3 nights to see if my insomnia is still bad. Then repeat, until my insomnia takes a break.

Never had an issue with dependency, and certainly not addiction. I use it when I need it, and stop it when I don't.

If I took it every night for months, then yes, I could see that developing into dependency.

But if you have been off it for 4 months, taking it for a few nights shouldn't be an issue. That's not long enough to develop dependence. Most studies indicate that takes longer than 28 days in a row."

I used to be a part of this community, it was actually the first time I ever made a Reddit account. I come back and post here once a year because everyone was so kind and helpful and I want to return that kindness. Someone here connected me with the resources that saved my life.

I began suffering from severe insomnia after a health complication years ago, sleeping on average 2-3 hours a night. I could fall asleep usually, but only stay asleep for 1-2 hours at a time. I would have 3 day periods fairly regularly with 0 hours. To make a long story short, I went to every doctor, got every test, and was put on several anxiety, sleep and anti depressant medications. No medications or supplements worked AT ALL. The anti depressants had terrible side effects, especially Trazadon. I quite literally tried over 50 supplements and medications. This carried on for nearly a year and I lost 1/4 my body weight. I did a full course of CBT and sleep restriction which helped, but didn’t cure me.

What truly saved my life was when I discovered a form of self-administered therapy that I could perform at home through someone on this subreddit. By this point I was ready to give up and die. But multiple people here told me that this changed their life and escape the hell hole my life had become. 

Many people here don’t have sleep problems, but rather severe sleep anxiety. You are stuck in a cycle of fight or flight, sleep terrifies you and has become your enemy. When you manage to fall asleep, if at all, it’s short and involves frequent wake ups. Your heart pounds through your chest, you can FEEL your heart beat when you lay down. Invasive thoughts and excess worry have raised your adrenaline and cortisol levels to unsustainable levels. You have a set of routines each night involving bathing, medication, supplementation, and other rituals. I also got severe chest pain and discomfort in my armpit.

The therapy I discovered is called Acceptance Commitment Therapy, or ACT. ACT saved my life and is applied to ALL aspects of life, beyond just sleep. The key principles of ACT at first seemed so simple to me that I had no hope they would work. How can we accept something that is ruining our life? How can we accept losing everything, our jobs bodies and minds?

I found an ACT book called The Sleep Book by Dr Guy Meadows. This book established that:

I need to accept my current circumstances. Without an acceptance, there is no recovery. Accepting a ruined life isn’t easy, but I HAD TO DO IT! I had to fight. A BIG part of this acceptance was monitoring my own thoughts, and embracing them. Instead of rejecting the thought “how will I go through tomorrow if I can’t sleep?! I can’t do it!”, I would let the thought happen, and then tell myself “I’m worrying about anxiety and sleep. That’s okay”. Don’t fight, accept. Embrace. The thoughts are OKAY. 

I needed to quit my rituals. I had to stop PREPARING for the night. I can’t suggest this (I’m not a doctor), but I did not recover until I quit all forms of medication cold turkey. I stopped 90% of supplements, stopped meds, and quit nearly every night ritual I had. I had to break free from the processes I built around my insomnia. 

I had to confront my thoughts, constantly throughout the day. The book touched on the two different types of suffering I was going through: my original suffering from not sleeping, and the amplified suffering from me worrying throughout the day about not sleeping. THIS IS KEY. You have the power to reduce the amplified pain, regardless of 0 hour nights. The book lays out several techniques and practices that can be utilized to manage your thoughts and anxiety. 

You must believe, this is temporary, you will get past this, and MANY of you can become completely better without medication. Anxiety doesn’t define you, it’s a temporary state of suffering you’re enduring that will help shape you into the person you become. 

Two years later, do I still have an occasional night of bad sleep? Even a string of nights? Sure. But it is incredibly rare now, and I never let it bring me back into the cycle of anxiety. I practice mindfulness and I accept these nights for what they are. 

I only promote this book because I believe it truly saved me. Within two weeks I was achieving 3-4 hour nights, and within a couple months was having 5-6 hour nights. Dr Guy Meadows Sleep Book.

I needed to quit my rituals. I had to stop PREPARING for the night. I can’t suggest this (I’m not a doctor), but I did not recover until I quit all forms of medication cold turkey. I stopped 90% of supplements, stopped meds, and quit nearly every night ritual I had. I had to break free from the processes I built around my insomnia. 

I had to confront my thoughts, constantly throughout the day. The book touched on the two different types of suffering I was going through: my original suffering from not sleeping, and the amplified suffering from me worrying throughout the day about not sleeping. THIS IS KEY. You have the power to reduce the amplified pain, regardless of 0 hour nights. The book lays out several techniques and practices that can be utilized to manage your thoughts and anxiety. 

You must believe, this is temporary, you will get past this, and MANY of you can become completely better without medication. Anxiety doesn’t define you, it’s a temporary state of suffering you’re enduring that will help shape you into the person you become. 

Two years later, do I still have an occasional night of bad sleep? Even a string of nights? Sure. But it is incredibly rare now, and I never let it bring me back into the cycle of anxiety. I practice mindfulness and I accept these nights for what they are. 

I only promote this book because I believe it truly saved me. Within two weeks I was achieving 3-4 hour nights, and within a couple months was having 5-6 hour nights. Dr Guy Meadows Sleep Book.

One effective way to deal with insomnia, is to relax. Sitting meditation is a very simple yet profoundly powerful way to relax. Don't sit a few second then rush to try to sleep. When you are into the body and mind relaxation stage, you feel it and you know it. Now you lie down and it's easy to fall asleep.

To help falling asleep faster, after sitting meditation, I lie down on my back, I will rotate my both ankles. This is very much like a hypnotizing pendant. Before I know it, it's morning wake up time."

5824,ha0njte,,,insomnia,1629715881,"if you've been one to never sleep before 2 a.m. your whole life (you say you've been this way since childhood) you probably have a circadian disorder. if you fall asleep before your natural sleep time, your body will likely consider it a nap, thats why you're wakin up. however, you have shift work, so there's other things at play here. 

check out r/DSPD &amp; the sidebar &amp; click info or just read the Wikipedia, maybe it'll sound like what you're goin thru in your life. r/N24 is one too, but yours doesn't sound like it.

with a circadian disorder sleep meds &amp; supplements won't help you change your rhythm long term, only a few things will. 

often times someone with DSPD that is forced to sleep early or wake early,  well that's like forcin a night sleeper to wake up at 4 a.m. their whole life. they'll feel like shit no matter what time they wake up or fall asleep cuz its outside of the body's circadian rhythm. check em out,  &amp; good luck!"

It most certainly isn't perfect, but is the only thing I have found that doesn't leave me with negative after effects. I also noticed that my body seems to adjust to whatever I was taking that kindof helped me sleep more, nothing has ever been 100 percent. Things like melatonin, benadryl, sleep teas would take the edge off, but than stop working. Maybe you could give something you tried in the past another shot and see if it works. Also, something I'm working on is trying to focus on the positive things in life so they outweigh the insomnia. The brain is able to rewire itself overtime so this may make sleeping easier. This is very difficult when anger, depression, anxiety, and dread are a constant companion with no sleep,  but I'm hoping it will pay off. I'm sorry you are struggling right now."

You seem defensive, I get that, when we are suffering we want anyone to help.  The do it yourself treatments and supplements aren’t helping, may be hurting you, for one it’s keeping you from getting medical advice.  

None of this is what you what to hear, I get that as well.  If you by chance live in the US, there’s free or low cost social services available to you especially if your going through hardship.

When I started out, I needed quite a  strong dose (300mg for 110lb female) but over the course of five years I’ve gotten down to around 12mg.

look into cbt for insomnia. a lot of your cognitive distortions (like feeling like your life is over) can worsen insomnia.

you can do it. i know it's so hard to be a student with insomnia. i believe in you!"
5872,h9zv4as,,,insomnia,1629693043,"Yes, many many many people have gotten over it lol. Sleep restriction I find is very effective as long as you can get sleep in. My first piece of advice is to stop worrying too much about your sleep. Anxiety might affect your insomnia.

Second piece of advice is to get out of bed if you can't sleep. And relax your mind and body for 30 mins before sleeping. When you enter bed, try sleeping for at least 45 mins in a calm state of mind as you normally would. If you can't sleep, don't get frustrated about it. Just leave bed and do something you like aside from intensive activity and exercise.

If you DO happen to get out of bed, don't look at bright screens. But I actually think it can be sometimes beneficial to look at warm screens. Get blue light filters on all your devices and set brightness to the lowest possible, with the application further lowering it.

Make an effort to get out in the day, even if you're just walking around. But I don't recommend just putting a chair in your backyard and feeling the sunlight, that's not very effective for other people I've known and myself.

Once you get your sleep associations and circadian rhythm better, you might be able to fall asleep for 2 days consecutively without too many issues.

If you can fall asleep for 2 days, that's your chance to do sleep restriction and fix your insomnia.

I'd advise melatonin if this is your first time experiencing insomnia. It's not dangerous at all and can help regulate your circadian rhythm and fix sleep schedule.

If you're waking up repeatedly, is it because of external factors like noise or temperature? I don't really have any advice for repeated wakes but I suppose you should try find ways to strengthen sleep quality. Including being exhausted from strenuous exercise.

Also, I tell you to relax yourself before bed but don't completely open your day's schedule to fix your insomnia. When you have nothing to do all day, your mind wanders around more and you'll get restless by the time you hit bed."
5873,h9zuau6,,,insomnia,1629692537,Sometimes there just is no drug available that'll help more than it hurts. Sleep seems to be one of the absolute trickiest things to treat.
5874,h9zu3y9,,,insomnia,1629692419,Most insomniacs are workers or students with jobs or classes which means they already have very consistent sleep and wake schedules yet they still suffer from insomnia. Insomnia doesn't care if one has a consistent sleep schedule. It will follow you to any schedule you set. Best to sleep when your brain can sleep regardless of schedule. Some people are morning larks and some people are night owls and this is genetically based.
5875,h9zu0cg,,,insomnia,1629692361,My recommendation stands.  Talk to your prescribing physician.  If you can’t get in (for whatever reason) talk to pharmacist- no appointment necessary.
5876,h9ztw97,,,insomnia,1629692292,"This might be unacceptable advice. But the most effective thing to cope with it is to change your job to one with which you don’t have to wake up at the certain time. We can’t get our insomnia over. That is a sad fact. 
To get us to sleep at night naturally is just like to get fish to breathe in the air. We simply can’t do it.

Because I also said that I'm not (i.e nicotine), they're just the medications I'm prescribed or OTC that I have, aka the medications I can take. and possibly the medications that could be disrupting my sleep, so someone could mention to not take diphenhydramine because of RLS, which I already mentioned and no even if they said that, I wouldn't just take their word for it.

Also if I said I couldn't make a doctors appointment with my regular provider, because we're talking about severe sleep deprivation and urgency and god knows when I'd be able to make an appointment to amount to nothing. What gives you the indication I'd be able to make an appointment with a specialist. 

Lmfao I have a current prescription for every single substance I listed, or at least have legalized use of that substance (i.e Diphenhydramine, and Doxylamine Succinate), with maybe the exception of the Ramelteon, which I only noted for context not exactly as if I was going to take advice without caution or advice at all. As I already explained, substances such as Diphenhydramine, and Doxylamine Succinate, and Melatonin are not really options due to my restless leg syndrome, I only listed things for proper context, not exactly toxicology advice. If someone told be to take Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) it doesn't mean I was going to do so, as I already know better and can list in detail the reasons why that's a bad idea. 

My only thing was what's the best course of actions to ensure sleep, and sleep hygiene in my given context, I know it's only people's opinions, and that's all it is, is mostly baseless input. But input that can give me ideas and remind me of things I already know, but forgot in my cognitively impaired state. If I was going to go consume illicit substances, I wouldn't be typing this, I'd be swallowing Diazepam at the moment. I agree with your concern, and agree with most of your notions, but I'm not taking advice to heart from random people on the internet, and going to follow them all willy nilly. I can 100% asure you that I'm not going to read a comment like, ""take alprazolam with alcohol"" and be like ""oh yeah that's a great idea"", I'm only regarding things to remind me of things I already know. Like maybe not to take cyclobenzaprine, because it's also anticholinergic and that could be effecting the Restless Leg Syndrome. 

But no I'm not a dumbass, just extremely sleep deprived.  I never asked for a drug combo, nor would I follow random opinions on it, when I already know drug interactions, and if I didn't there's drug bank for that."

It seems dreary and depressing over there. However, the USA has a lot of challenges, especially in the political realm.

5900,h9zby7k,,,insomnia,1629682666,"I had insomnia for a few months straight (the sleep maintenance kind), and no medication seemed to help much. I think my insomnia started with covid, and then possibly got worse because of the vaccine (maybe just a coincidence with timing, though).

Mirtazapine stopped working, and even when it did work I felt like a zombie. Trazodone and diphenhydramine did nothing but give me a hangover. Hydroxizine and gabapentin did nothing. Xanax got me a couple of good hours, but I couldn’t just keep taking that. 

I tried Silenor, and that was actually pretty helpful. I was taking 6 mg and had 0 hangover. Also, my cortisol levels were high, so I started taking ashwagandha. And I stopped taking vitamin D and omega 3 in case they were contributing to the insomnia. 

Somehow I’m sleeping ok now, and I don’t know if it was just time in my case, or if some combination of the stuff in the above paragraph helped. I never thought I would have a normal night of sleep again. I’m terrified it won’t continue but am hoping for the best. I hope that you find some relief, too."

5906,h9yz1g9,,,insomnia,1629676311,I've found Temazepam to be good for onset insomnia but it has such a short half life that with real bad sleep anxiety you're jolted awake just about 2hrs after you take it.  Longer acting benzos like Klonopin have proven more useful because they help control anxiety all day which is essential to getting a good night's sleep. You can be anxious all day long and just magically expect to sleep all night.

5912,h9yu0rf,,,insomnia,1629673883,"Honestly, I don’t know, but I think you are too young to be prescribed all those meds. 

If you can persuade your Dr. to refer you to a sleep specialist they maybe able to help you. TBH my doctor was very dismissive of my insomnia and you may find some resistance from your own doc. They just don’t think it’s a big deal, but it really is. 

Some things you can do: wear an eye mask to decrease light and/or use black out curtains, sleep in a cooler environment, kind of slow down 2-3 hours before you sleep. For instance, no REDDIT, etc. 

Also I saw this guy on YouTube who  did a breathing and rhythmic tapping thing and he said it helped him fall asleep. I tried , but it didn’t work for me, but everyone is different. 

If you have lots of intrusive thoughts before bed keep a pad by your bed and write them down. For instance, I am always thinking of my “to-do” list before bed and it keeps me up, but if I write it down I know I won’t forget it and will deal with it tomorrow 

I really hope you find a solution"
5913,h9ytg5x,,,insomnia,1629673606,"I'd get a couple hours laying on the couch downstairs by trying to sleep on my stomach, somehow the anxiety wasnt as.bad on my stomach as on my back.  But they were terrible anxiety sleeps and I'd wake up from whatever sleep I got feeling like I had run a 5k and literally shaking in fear from this random anxiety.

With SRT I began with 2hrs allowed in bed per night.  After two nights of this or so I crashed and passed out for those two hours.  I pretty quickly got up to 4hrs in bed.  That may not seem like much, but it was solid consolidated sleep.  And it felt like a new beginning because I was in control of getting the sleep.  I was able to function pretty well at work with this much sleep.  It wasn't the end of my sleep anxiety but over the months it improved and I no longer had problems falling asleep when I went to bed, which was a huge morale boost."
5914,h9ysq80,,,insomnia,1629673260,How many hours were you getting a night for those 3 years? And what did you do for sleep restriction therapy
5915,h9yrlec,,,insomnia,1629672720,"I had very severe insomnia, so bad just laying down on a couch would cause me an anxiety attack.  Lying there night after night trying to fool my mind into sleeping I also had dark thoughts about how I couldn't go on living like this.  This went on for almost 3yrs.  

FF to today and I get 6-7hrs per night, have no daily anxiety, and the only.sleep anxiety I have is first thing in the morning until I get of bed and it is continuing to get better.  Things.that worked:


1. sleep restriction therapy.  This was the most important thing I ever did because it proved to me that I could sleep again.  It cured my sleep onset insomnia.  

2. Antidepressants and benzos.  Getting only a couple hours of sleep a night for months on end leads to depression and anxiety disorders.  And depression and anxiety leads to insomnia...vicious circle.  The drugs helped to arrest the downward spiral.  Benzos didn't work at first because my insomnia was so bad,.but as it improved they became more effective.  

3. Therapy.  Not any use for sleep itself, but through therapy I was able to identify underlying root causes of anxiety in my life (chronic pain condition and professional situation)

4. Solving the root causes.  In my case I had a couple hip surgeries and feel like I'm 20yr younger and can be active again.  I am also quitting my job and am firmly in the DGAF at work.  This has really coincided with my sleep improving.  

I am currently tapering off cymbalta and don't really need the Klonopin much other than after a.step down in cymbalta dose.  My sleep is improving.  

It doesn't have to be forever,.but you need.to be your own advocate with doctors and therapists and take charge of your condition.  People don't understand how debilitating sleep anxiety is."
5916,h9yr42n,,,insomnia,1629672495,Do you sleep without waking up several times during the night? Our brain goes through 4 stages every 1.5 hour and if you manage to fall asleep for at least 3 hours that means that you are going through deep sleep and rem sleep 2 times so it isn't only light sleep (the first stage of the cycle).
5917,h9yqv75,,,insomnia,1629672379,"I am in the same boat, however have only tried Trazodone for prescription meds. Tried weed,CBD, all the otc stuff. 

I’ve had chronic insomnia for most of my life but ultimately was able to catch up on sleep and did fine. Last 4 months have been pure hell. I essentially have had zero deep sleep and only REM. I get about 2 hours a night and 4 hours if I am lucky. I can’t sleep more then 30 minutes at a time. Always jolted awake by a vivid dream. I’m close to quitting my job and just lay in bed. I’m 30 and also like you, having a mental breakdown. Prescription meds never helped my Depression or anxiety and I’m worried it won’t help my sleep. But I need to try.

5988,h9xv1g8,,,insomnia,1629658112,Whenever i mentioned this issue to others they say u r 24 grow up others have kids and you are complaining about sleep and no one really cares because it is not their problem and they cannot do anything for you

Every time I go through a series of sleepless nights and then I was able to sleep well for one night --  I catch myself looking at the clock and be so surprised and happy. 

Insomnia has taught me so much about self-compassion. I used to get angry at myself for not being able to sleep which causes me even more anxiety. Though I'm not an expert at it yet, I tell myself that it's not my fault that I couldn't sleep and it's out of my control."
5993,h9xq66y,,,insomnia,1629656009,"Melatonin is not a sleeping pill, and its only proven to have some effect on resetting your sleep schedule for things like jet lag, shift work, etc. It doesn't help people get more sleep, and it's only acting as a placebo in those cases.

You can dispute it works etc if you wish, however the report won't change that, you can interpret the report however you wish and disagree with me. The report makes no judgement on the effectiveness of it along with a primary treatment. 

It's a report, my opinion on its importance 
 is based on facts, personal and professional experience.

I think you are young, and if you could take some time away ?   I am bedridden so stuck
I don’t know if chronic insomnia can damage the brain - but I do think meds can disrupt the neurology of the sleep wake cycle.

Yes you are correct, I missed or forgot this part. This invalidates my claim that the aasm implicitly allowed sleep hygiene as an adjunct, they recommend it explicitly.

6025,h9x2qkg,,,insomnia,1629645969,What you are describing are panic attacks.  Some guided sleep meditation may help put you in a good headspace before bedtime.  This can happen after long periods of stress.  Research some stress reducing methods and practice those improvements.

6028,h9x10fn,,,insomnia,1629645185,Seroquel is an antipsychotic prescribed off label for sleep.  It isn’t a sleeping pill but prescribers may use it that way to counter insomnia caused by antidepressants.  Antidepressants are notorious for causing insomnia even Mirtazapine even though it has two mechanisms of action that cause sedation the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors can cause insomnia.   It may be worth asking your pharmacist for an over the counter sleep aid to cross taper to that may be easier to taper off.
6029,h9x0k8k,,,insomnia,1629644981,I also have a sleep mask to block out any light whatsoever and I recommend getting a really good secure one that won't slip off your face in the middle of the night
6030,h9x0cxp,,,insomnia,1629644889,"Yes -- I have some advice -- turn the phone off.  Completely.  About an hour before bed too.  And keep it off all night.  Don't turn it on until morning.

There's many other things you can do that actually work besides go on your phone when you can't sleep.  Especially important is keeping a consistent wake time without sleeping in or napping later.  

There could be many other factors, hard to say from your post.  But look up sleep hygiene for  starters for some ideas."
6031,h9x08bu,,,insomnia,1629644830,"If it's any consolation, I realized that this happens to me in the summer when the sun rises so early and stops when fall sets in. The worst sleep occurring around the solstice in June. From the sounds of it, this started happening to you at the beginning of the summer so maybe when school starts things will get better and this will only be a seasonal issue.

The way I've learned to cope with it is either smoking weed which usually will knock me right back out or taking xanax. Those are the only two things that don't make me groggy if I take them at 5am. Wouldn't really recommend xanax as you have to be so careful not to become dependent on it but I will get that for insomnia if I am traveling for example and obviously cannot bring weed around with me."
6032,h9x01vi,,,insomnia,1629644751,"Unlikely the nicotine cessation is having much impact at this point.  Likely other factors you describe, particularly stress about sleep, playing more of a role.

Stay with your good sleep behaviors, they are important.  Ask your doc/therapist about using a full CBT sleep training program, as this gives you more tools like sleep hygiene -- particularly stress management and cognitive restructuring -- that are substance free and permanent."
6033,h9wzp3n,,,insomnia,1629644592,"If you do nap, keep it under about 20 minutes max -- otherwise it can in effect steal sleep from the following night.

Otherwise, give yourself lots of time.  Using SR, like the other CBT methods, takes time.  For me, up to a full year of using all the CBT sleep training methods before I reached a point of what might be considered normal.  What you find is there is no ""normal"", only what works for you."
6034,h9wxheo,,,insomnia,1629643599," Being an insomniac is the loneliest thing.  I envy people who can sleep whereever whenever. 

My insomnia is good for a few weeks, then bad for a few weeks. Friends and family don't get the  ""I don't want to hang out or talk or do anything because I sleep like shit last night and everynight the past week"" 

My current insomnia has me waking up about 4.5 to 5.5 hours into my night and it's become hard to fell back asleep.  In the past I use to struggle to fell asleep, but lucky I found out how to sleep when I lay down, I just can't stay asleep long enough. 

I also hate the advice people try to give me....""Melatonin! No I never thought about trying that!"" ""I bet that's the cure all!"" What a joke."

6038,h9wuqtv,,,insomnia,1629642341,"You have said yourself that the reason you couldn't fall asleep was anxiety, the more you didn't sleep the more that anxiety developed into a fear of another sleepless night, creating a cycle. You don't have to rely on the pills to fall asleep, especially because the duration of your insomnia has been so short. If you have the option you could search for professional help with your anxiety, but I am pretty sure psychotherapy will be enough for you. Another tip: when you're trying to fall asleep, rather than telling yourself ""i have to fall asleep"" try to focus on *resting* instead. Sleep is this way - the more you chase it the farther away it gets, because you are trying too hard and keeping your brain ""on"". So instead just rest, think about how comfy the bed is etc"
6039,h9wubob,,,insomnia,1629642147,"It’s where you set a time frame (mine was 2-7 AM) that you’re allowed to sleep, and then slowly push the time earlier and earlier. The goal is that, since you’re exhausting yourself, your sleep quality improves, and you won’t wake up throughout the night, and it improves your sleep quality.

I’m grasping for straws as to not make too many conclusions, that said the sleep schedule you set may have you continue getting the same or a tad less as you adjust.  Gradually make increments, when you stabilize, adjust again.  Be consistence with your routine, eating, exercise (if you do) or anything you do in a day and allow your body clock to adjust."

You sound super busy, stressed and have added stress from insomnia which only acerbates us into having more insomnia.  Anger over insomnia is stress, I get it.  I get angry too at times.  I’d truly start with your doctor."
6047,h9wk5vx,,,insomnia,1629636825,"You shouldn't be teriffied of seeing a doctor! It's very helpful in dealing with insomnia for a couple reasons:
1. A doctor can run a few tests to make sure your insomnia isn't caused by an underlying illness (this is very rare if you have no other symptoms, but it feels better to know for sure)
2. Medicine isn't the only useful tool with insomnia. The main goal is to be able to sleep naturally. Most cases of insomnia are caused by anxiety, with which a therapist might be able to help you through psychotherapy."

Definitely was anxiety, I didn't get good sleep and then whenever I tried to sleep again i had anxiety over *not being able to fall asleep* so everytime i was about to fall asleep my heart started racing. It's normal because when you're entering sleep your heart rate increases naturally. It's a normal process. However the reason it startles you is because you're constantly in an anxious state or ""clenched up"".The key is to try to stop trying to *fall asleep* and focus on trying to *rest*. It's either way better if you rest in bed and don't sleep than if you don't rest at all."

If your body clock needs adjusting, set your wake time to 6 am and back up your bedtime to accommodate those hours. You def don’t want to be spending too much time in bed, so you could wake 6, bed time at 11.  

If the shift is too much you could use 5:30 wake time, bed time 10:30, stabilize then adjust again.  If the 30 mins is too much, maybe do 15-20 min shifts.

It is ineffective as a primary treatment yes, however when combined with other treatments it may be useful and should be used. The report you keep banging on about clearly states this. 

Lots of treatments for illnesses have additional treatments that won't cure the illness but benefit the patient in some way when used alongside the primary treatment. 

Cancer, talking therepy, support groups etc won't cure it but when used as a treatment alongside the medical treatment can help the patient mentally cope. You're conclusions are so flawed it's clear you don't understand what you are talking about."

honestly, i often watch tv or play video games (relaxing ones like animal crossing) before bed. i think as long as your screens are on warm mode and you're not scrolling social media, it's fine. social media is too stimulating otherwise."

6101,h9vi00h,,,insomnia,1629607343,"I know how you feel. I have also suffered from severe insomnia for over ten years. Extreme trauma from childhood abuse. It explodes from the subconscious whenever I try to sleep. It takes me about five hours of continually waking and going back to bed before I can finally rest.

I do shift work with hours that start late in the morning so I can work around my insomnia. My boss keeps trying to assign me eleven hour shifts that start at 4:00 in the morning. I have to say no and I am penalized for it, even though when I was hired I negotiated my hours and work area. They simply don't understand it is impossible for me to work an eleven hour shift on literally zero sleep.

What they don't know  is I am barely able to hold it together as it is. When they put these demands upon me, it triggers me and I feel like I am about to lose it. It takes all my effort to handle the responsibilities I have. Being able to do that is the glue that holds my life together. When I am made to feel I am failing at that one thing, my life becomes unglued.

It is extremely hard to work a job with severe insomnia, trauma and mental illness. I am doing the best I can and I have to hide it from everyone. No one understands."

6116,h9uy9kx,,,insomnia,1629596962,"Yo, this is me for sure.

I started doing sleep restriction to re-train my body and mind to sleep again.

I start on a Monday and limit my sleep to max 4 hours.  Don't go to bed till 2am and my alarm goes off at 6am.  Do this for the work week and also through the weekend.

Usually by then, after I lay down I'm in a deep sleep within 5-10 min.  Then I'll bump bed time back by an hour.  Never letting myself sleep more than 5 hours a night.  Next week is 6 and by then I'm usually fixed for several months to a year.

It is stress, but half of that stress comes from being over tired and not having the right mix of chemicals running through your body by the end of the day.  Most of my anxiety that keeps me awake comes from being afraid I won't get a good night's sleep.  If I guarantee myself i won't get a good sleep, I don't give my brain the chance to hijack my thoughts."
6117,h9uy2xu,,,insomnia,1629596875,"For me, the no phone thing is totally counterproductive. If I'm not doing something like a puzzle or reading until it gets hard for me to keep my eyes open, I'm very likely to toss and turn for ages.

I even avoid caffeinated soda and decaf coffee for the last six hours. But having my phone in bed is actually helpful, my anxiety levels are high enough that being alone with my thoughts is the worst possible thing for sleep. 

Definitely try all the things, then figure out what works for you."
6120,h9uu7qz,,,insomnia,1629595013,"Exactly, if it gets you the help you need then it's worth it."
6121,h9ut64n,,,insomnia,1629594485,"I don't see anyone here suggesting that you throw sleep *routine* out the window. You're confusing sleep routine and [sleep hygiene](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene), though. They have commonalities (sleep hygiene is also very routine-based) but ""**A central component of sleep hygiene beyond just habits is your sleep environment.** To fall asleep more easily, you want your bedroom to emanate tranquility."" That's the central difference - I can have functional routines, but if my computer is in my bedroom, my sleep specialist will tell me I've got poor sleep hygiene practices. Ditto if I'm reading in bed. That's because sleep hygiene theory is centered on the assumption that beds and bedrooms must be for sleeping and sex and nothing else, and if you don't keep to that restriction then it's no wonder you can't sleep.

But.... well... If this is all scientific and whatnot, that your bedroom must ""emanate tranquility,"" then I need someone to scientifically explain why sleep hygiene *also* tells us we get to have sex in bed. Sex is, unless you're doing it wrong, pretty damn stimulating and exciting, and that's *exactly* what sleep hygiene theory tells us has NO place in the bed or bedroom. No books in bed! Absolutely *no* exercise equipment in the bedroom! *Definitely* never any work tasks in the bedroom! But orgasms (or sexual frustration, I suppose!) somehow magically don't have an effect on your sleep?

**That makes no sense even based exclusively on the internal logic of sleep hygiene.** The sex exception exists purely because they realized that you just cannot tell people not to have sex in bed. But the fact that they're like ""hm yeah sex is totally fine"" *also* calls into question the entire premise, because they're trying to have it both ways. ""Your bedroom must be tranquil and calm, nothing that distracts from sleep should be present"" simply does not make sense when paired with ""except sex,"" which is pretty much the opposite of ""tranquil and calm.""

Either doing physically and/or mentally stimulating things in bed is bad, or it's not. Having sex in bed is fine, but reading your old childhood books in bed is absolutely too stimulating? Nah. Makes no sense.

Sleep routine, on the other hand, is really important, and contributes to healthy sleep. The best aspects of sleep hygiene are the bits where they focus on building a routine that works for you. But the ""hygiene"" aspect - keeping your bedroom free of anything that distracts from sleep - just isn't internally consistent and shows the weakness of the whole theory.

edited to add, u/lrq3000, you seem to have done a lot of research in this area, is there an explanation here that I'm missing *and that makes sense*?"
6122,h9usgdd,,,insomnia,1629594130,I feel like I’ve been ridiculously dramatic but if it helps get me out of this breakdown it can’t be a bad thing.

6125,h9uqnlj,,,insomnia,1629593246,"You literally do not understand the data. It literally says it should be used in combination with other therapies lol. 

So according to your interpretation of the treatment for any condition only a primary treatment can be beneficial? Any supplemental treatment is just a harmless ritual. 

So what's the treatment for insomnia then? Drugs and just drugs? Therapies and just therapy? The guidelines state a combination can be used. But you understand it as only a primary treatment should be used. I think you clearly need to understand what you are trying to interpret because you haven't a clue."
6126,h9uqgmz,,,insomnia,1629593149,"Yeah it's similar to depression in that those who don't have it can never understand just how debilitating it is to a persons life. I hate it when someone comes into work and says something like ""I'm not feeling too great today, only managed six hours sleep last night"". Oh yeah Karen? Try coming to work on ZERO hours sleep."
6127,h9uogms,,,insomnia,1629592151,"Yes, they precisely state that sleep hygiene should not be used as a standalone therapy. They do not say anything specific about using it as an adjunct therapy, they leave the option open implicitly (not explicitly).

But if they found no efficacy as a primary, standalone therapy, there is no reason to think it would fare better as an adjunct therapy, absolutely no reason.

As you said, these tips are applied to everyone, including typical sleepers. But here we are discussing in an insomnia sub, so my comments and refs pertain to insomnia. Whether these tips are helpful for typical sleepers is irrelevant if they are ineffective for insomniacs. And this is what the review demonstrates: sleep hygiene on its own does not lead to objectively measurably significant improvements in the sleep parameters of insomniacs.

Imho the aasm authors left it as an open option as adjunct like it was done for homeopathy. If it's not used as a primary therapy, it's usually not harmful, but it's not useful nor necessary either, but if it can make some insomniac people feel better about themselves then why not. We aren't going to ban harmless rituals."
6128,h9un8ef,,,insomnia,1629591545,"That's not what sleep hygiene is. There is a clinical definition of its items, in fact there are several. Acknowledging the inefficacy of sleep hygiene doesn't mean I suggest the extreme opposite, this is a straw man fallacy.

Knowing how the sleep processes work is sufficient to predict most of what is or isn't good to do for sleep.

An alternative is to consult the latest aasm position statement on sleep, although this pertains more to typical sleepers than insomniacs, who require specific interventions targeting insomnia.

Ps: interestingly thi original sleep hygiene tips specifically recommended to turn on lights at night if unable to sleep. This shows that sleep hygiene tips do not necessarily help for sleep, they can be counterproductive."
6129,h9un21x,,,insomnia,1629591454,"I have read it, it does clearly state good sleep hygiene should still be practiced regardless of other treatments. It doesn't state it is useless and not important. I have also never claimed it will solely cure insomnia. Good sleep hygiene is important for everyone. Plenty of proof of that."
6130,h9ulvta,,,insomnia,1629590865,"So you are a clinician, i also suspected that. Well, maybe it's time to catch up with the latest evidence instead of relying on your experience only? You should know that our experiences can be biased, that's why we have clinical trials. Please read the aforementioned systematic review by the aasm on behavioral therapies, its conclusions are very clear about sleep hygiene, it's not my interpretation."
6131,h9ul77l,,,insomnia,1629590533,"Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i), for behavioral therapies. The aasm review is very interesting, they done a deep and detailed review of virtually all currently available behavioral therapies, I highly recommend reading it. They found that for the moment only CBT-i has demonstrated some efficacy in properly controlled clinical trials, it helps about one third of insomniac patients.

There are also pharmacological therapies but this is part of other guidelines from the aasm, and to my knowledge they aren't yet updated (last version was released in 2008), contrary to behavioral therapies guidance."

Get up and get going at your wake time and really tire yourself out during the day.  

Over the course of several weeks that should reset your body clock, and you'll then begin to feel drowsy enough for sleep roughly 15-17 hours later.  However, avoid spending too much time in bed -- only the min needed for proper sleep."

One of the CBT methods is to fix your seriously messed up sleep schedule.  For instance, if your body's giving you 7 am why not go with it, and keep that very consistent without sleeping in or napping later.  Over the course of several weeks (not just one day) that should reset your body clock.  You'll then begin to feel drowsy enough for sleep roughly 15-17 hours later.

Distraction can work -- can be as simple as counting sheep or more involved like deep abdominal breathing.

Before getting covid, I was able to read my phone right before bed and sleep all night. And now that I’m sleeping better, I’m able to be on my phone before bed and I sleep great. Not like I make a habit out of it or anything, but if I need to look at my phone it doesn’t seem to affect my sleep. I don’t always go to bed at the same time, either.

6151,h9txb19,,,insomnia,1629579039,It's important and I follow all the rules but still have insomnia. I'm a naturally anxious person so I think I got so obsessed with trying to get a good night's sleep and the pre bed routine that I tend to ruminate about it and get anxious during the few hours before bed now.
6152,h9tws2c,,,insomnia,1629578798,"Most normal sleepers don't even know what sleep hygiene is. They can sleep anywhere at any time.

…no. it’s a totally debilitating disease that has given me some of the worst days of my life. it’s not “trouble sleeping.”"
6159,h9tit1v,,,insomnia,1629572318,"I think what you're seeing here is evidence of what you're saying. It's helped some people, who therefore think that the research saying it's unlikely to help is bunkus, *and* there's so much lack of understanding of sleep that we're likely to cling to whatever we've been told. It's easier to tell myself that I bet I *could* sleep better if I really tried than to acknowledge that all the sleep hygiene in the world isn't going to make me sleep. 

I also think insomnia, like many chronic conditions, probably has about the usual 20-30% placebo response to any medication, and some people are getting that from sleep hygiene. Which - hey, awesome for them! I'm jealous! Still doesn't mean it works the way we've been told it does, but whatever helps ya sleep."

6166,h9tdiih,,,insomnia,1629569886,"15mg of Mirtazapine has pretty much cured my insomnia, so long as I keep taking them. I haven’t slept as good as I have these past few months since I was in my early teens. I tried Zopiclone too but it didn’t help much."
6167,h9tdho4,,,insomnia,1629569876,"There is no evidence of that either

And I find it funny you tell me i am clueless and concluded my statements were based on hearsay when I mention the date of creation of the original sleep hygiene tips as well as the aasm guidelines.

But as usual when lacking evidence, believers in this harmful therapy just resort to ad personam attacks, I'm used to that. Indeed, you asked for a lot of proofs, but provided none, even though I delivered. Again, not surprised.

OP will see for themselves anyway after trying."
6168,h9tdh4h,,,insomnia,1629569869,Yes I totally understand this. I always feel so alone at this time. Over thinking every detail of my day or things that have happened in the past. Actually it’s 4am here now as I write this.
6169,h9tcv42,,,insomnia,1629569591,"I get it from time to time. The first few times was so scary because I didn’t know what sleep paralysis was. The feeling of an evil presence there, that’s the pressure of being unable to move that makes you feel that something is holding you down. Sometimes you can also dream with it and see figures which makes it terrifying. Now I know what it is I can almost calm myself whenever it happens. Apparently it’s more common when you have a poor sleeping schedule so it comes with insomnia unfortunately. But it is completely harmless, just a nuisance, that occurs for me maybe a couple of times a year now"
6170,h9tcucv,,,insomnia,1629569581,Yes it's not a primary treatment but it's still vital and important. You're clearly clueless.
6171,h9tcr0u,,,insomnia,1629569540,"Thanks for the reply. my problem started after working graveyard shifts for a a few years  7 pm to 7am before that i used to sleep like a baby. my problem is not staying asleep but actually falling asleep or getting sleepy at  normal hours since i dont work graveyard shifts anymore once i fall asleep ill sleep for over 8 hours if possible  i could wake up in the middle of the night to use restroom and go right back to sleep cause im in the sleepy stage but once i got a few days with out sleep i get super cranky and lash out for simple things. As soon as im able to get a good nights rest all the crankyness goes away…. This really sucks.
Also usually between noon and 4 pm il get the urge to take the best nap with no meds or nothing to induce it i wish i can feel the urge to sleep like that when I actually need it. Its like my circadian rythmn is completely fucked!!"
6172,h9tcb5v,,,insomnia,1629569339,"I cannot link on this sub without getting the post shadowbanned for a while, so blame the mods. I mentioned two refs:

* the aasm systematic review and meta analysis on behavioral therapies, published in 2021. They state that prescribing sleep hygiene as a primary therapy is harmful as it has no positive effect and delays proper management of insomnia.
* my document VLIDACMEL which synthesize this review and others and the origins (and issues) of sleep hygiene tips.

So no, it's not hearsay. I am trained in research, i work on academic publications.

Believing in sleep hygiene's efficrcy is however certainly based on hearsay since it clearly hasn't shown any efficacy despite the many clinical trials and being the oldest behavioral intervention for insomnia. That's the conclusion of the aasm."
6173,h9tbpuk,,,insomnia,1629569076,"No one mentioned essential oils. Rubbish, loads of recent studies show maintaining good sleep hygiene is vital. Any actual proof it's useless or you just going on something you heard?"
6174,h9tbjsp,,,insomnia,1629569001,"Well if that works for you, then that's good. At one point, I just took Lexapro but it didn't help me at all with my sleep problems (I couldn't stay asleep through the whole night). It's only when I took it in conjunction with a sedative that I could finally sleep for 7-8 hours."
6175,h9tb7ez,,,insomnia,1629568847,"Proper sleep hygiene is essential for your physical and mental health. Start by waking up at the same time. Usually the wake up time sets the schedule to a more normalized sleep time. If you’re using electronics set it to dark mode. Ideally, you only use your bed to sleep. Good luck. 

Also things like avoiding caffeine are all part of it too."
6176,h9tb61e,,,insomnia,1629568830,"Yes, just like essential oils aren't going to improve your insomnia.

The consensus is already changing, clinicians are already advised to stop recommending sleep hygiene as a therapy. In a few decades, this will become common knowledge, that sleep hygiene is rubbish."
6177,h9tb565,,,insomnia,1629568820,"Not all depressions can be treated with the same drugs. Case in point: I took about 200mg of seroquel for about a month to help me with sleep, and seroquel can help with depression,  but it didn't do anything to help me feel less depressed... It's only later that I learned seroquel was better suited for bipolar depression. With Lexapro on the other hand, I felt an effect right away. But just taking Lexapro didn't help me get more sleep, it just made me feel less crappy when I was sleep-deprived. It's when I took another drug to sedate me at night that i finally experienced normal sleep (my main issue with sleep was that I'd be wide awake after 2-4 hours of sleep, even though I was exhausted, with the drug combination I finally got 7-8 hours of fairly uninterrupted sleep).

In any case, all anti-depressants need a prescription, so you should really see psychiatrists to begin getting treatment for whatever you may have."
6178,h9taqyu,,,insomnia,1629568644,Sorry are you actually saying good sleep hygiene isn't important? Absolute rubbish if that's what you are saying.
6179,h9tabhy,,,insomnia,1629568452,"No, it doesn't, see my refs by searching vlidacmel. Even the latest AASM guidelines state this is a relic of the past.

Consider it like grandma recipes, sometimes they do help, sometimes they don't but you still feel better just doing them out of habit, and sometimes they are just downright bad (eg, the original sleep hygiene tips in the 70s recommended to turn on lights at night if you couldn't sleep, which is a perfect recipe to actually keep you awake!)."

There have been a couple of reports of myocarditis in teens within a couple of days of getting the vaccine.

Fatigue  
Heart palpitations  
Chest pain or pressure  
Lightheadedness  
Swelling in the hands, legs, ankles and feet  
A sudden loss of consciousness""

Fatigue is a known, common side effect of the covid vaccines, so, taken on its own, I wouldn't worry about that. I, my husband, and my teenage son all experienced fatigue after both shots. 

Based on what I'm reading, it would be hard to not notice the symptoms, and it's not something that happens suddenly overnight. It also seems easily treatable in its early stages, should you actually be one of the rare ones that actually do have it."
6206,h9skqyw,,,insomnia,1629556881,"It’s anxiety. 
This won’t be the antidote but having this two points consider will help you a lot : 
1. You can’t control your anxiety. The thought of your anxiety and that you can’t sleep while falling asleep will make you more anxious. Just accept is there, let it be there, just put it there in some space of your mind and don’t control let, don’t focus too much on it, let it be and just don’t try to avoid it because that will keep you more tied up to that anxiety, just, as I said, put it in some space of your mind. 
2. You can’t control your sleep. Knowing that, your body will fall asleep alone, no matter how much you or your anxiety try to resist it. You can’t control it, you can only delay it if you don’t acknowledge the step one. 
3. Take a herbal tea with passiflora or actually anything warm (that is not green tea neither back coffee or coffee hahaha). 
4. Acknowledge it’s normal to be anxious, we all go through tough times and you aren’t alone on this one. Find a way to ease your anxiety as well during the day. All the thoughts that come to bother you at night are the thoughts you didn’t process during day because you were busy or weren’t paying too much attention to your body. 
   1. Drink less coffee even during the day
    2. Do meditation at least twice or three times a week. Or just close your eyes and talk to yourself, ask how your day was. 
3. Don’t be too tough with yourself if you have anxiety. Just let it be there but don’t start adding more negativeness, don’t worry too much if you can’t sleep at that moment, don’t starts thinking you have a huge problem."

When my insomnia gets better, I stop taking it. First night when I stop is usually bad sleep, but it gets much better the second and subsequent nights. So, I don't think I have developed any tolerance or dependence, even after years of taking it. But I only take it about 50% of the time, so that might help.

Diphenhydramine can work if my insomnia isn't really bad, but it can leave me tired the next day. However, no prescription needed for it (Benadryl)."
6227,h9s11yf,,,insomnia,1629545796,"It took a few minutes to look at this.  I’ll let you dig into researching this on your own.  

Based in the video he had a rare syndrome caused by the cipro (Fluoroquinolones: Cipro, Levaquin &amp; Avelox are antiobiotics in this class) which over the years have now carried the most severe black box warnings from the FDA in the US.  There’s a sub here where others discuss being floxed or there’s a name in which they are called floxies (see r/floxies). 

The video shows him drifting off but being jolted awake, I can only think these are micro sleeps and he probably had a lot of them in a 24 period of course I’m not a scientist, doctor or experienced/knowledgeable of being ‘floxed’ but from what I read there is rare fatal instances caused by these drugs.

6233,h9ruz36,,,insomnia,1629540816,"Clonazepam and zopiclone are the only pills I've found truly effective for sleep. They are sedating the next day until you build up a tolerance for them (not an ideal situation though). Temazepam is a shorter acting benzo used for sleep that some people get success from - I was mixing it with zopiclone so can't tell you how effective it is alone sorry.

From what I know, quetiapine is apparently more for sleep at lower doses like 25mg or less (someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), but you could try taking low dose quetiapine and seeing how you feel the next day?

If you havent tried melatonin it might be worth a shot? They arent that strong so might take your body a while to get used to sleeping without stronger meds before they actually work but shouldn't really be sedating the next day. Could also try something like phenergen? Again, haven't tried it personally but know some people that find it effective."

6235,h9rtvmo,,,insomnia,1629539845,"Here are some ideas of what to try

\-CBD

\-Neurofeedback (normalizes brain waves)

\-Gabapentin (if you can find a doctor that will prescribe)"
6236,h9rtsgo,,,insomnia,1629539767,"I can’t say my response is as strong as yours but I absolutely can relate. Having to get up early causes me a tremendous amount of stress bc I know my body doesn’t want to do it and I’ll be exhausted, which exacerbates my anxiety and makes it harder to fall asleep, worsening the whole situation. I haven’t gotten to a place to offer any life-changing advice, but I can tell you what I do to cope. 

1) if it’s predictable, plan around it. Try to get up an hour earlier each day leading up to it, don’t drink the night (or days) before 
2) plan that day meticulously the night before. Have your clothes laid out, write a list of anything you need to bring with you to make the day more comfortable (water bottle should always be on that list!), and write a schedule for that morning (I.e. 9 get up and have tea and breakfast, 9:45 shower brush teeth get ready, 10:15 pack bag and be ready to go) so you can wrap your head around how the morning will go ahead of time and have less to think about when you wake up
3) give yourself more time in the morning than you need, even if it means telling yourself you have to get up an hour and a half earlier than you would need to, then you expect that, can sleep in another half hour/45 minutes, and then have another 45 minutes extra to take the morning slow
4) drink TONS of water. Your brain needs water, anxiety works the brain, and so does lack of sleep. Drinking way more water than usual the night before and when you wake up make the whole process a lot easier 
And 5) if you need it, meds. If I know I’ll have to get up earlier than normal I’ll take a Benadryl type otc sleeping pill (if you have to fall asleep a few hours earlier than you usually do this isn’t advised, you might end up lying awake just feeling funny, but one or two hours earlier helps, and don’t make a habit of it). But on the other end, if you don’t go the Benadryl route and are having to operate on little sleep and feeling anxious, you might consider anxiety meds. Also not advised regularly by any means. I haven’t needed it for a while because I’ve worked this system pretty well, but if I have to get up really early and haven’t gotten sleep, .25mg of Xanax really helps my insomniac sleep deprived brain to get around the tasks of the day without losing my cool. Of course talk to a doctor about that if you’re going to be driving or anything but just an idea. 

Hope some of this helps! I feel you."

6239,h9ro99x,,,insomnia,1629534831,"Careful with what you eat, avoid too much sugar, including fruit high in sugar, spicy food,  processes foods and breads.

Eating certain things like banana, nuts, cherries, kiwi can be good as they contain magnesium or melatonin. 

Have you tried herbal sleep aids, can get these as teas, tablets in health food shops like Holland and Barrett. Something like valerian."
6240,h9rndps,,,insomnia,1629534052,"I go through exactly this. Things that have helped me are - first going to bed with the mindset that you are just going to rest. Do not think about ""sleep"". Just lay down in bed and feel you are just relaxing.. no pressure.. whatever happens.. happens. Feel how the bed is comfy and how you are just relaxing. The key here is to 'feel' all this. Not 'think'. If this not enough, you can meditate while laying down. (Gently draw your attention to the light in your heart or breath).  


Well there are days when my mind is running so much and it takes a lot more time to fall asleep. But the things I mentioned above has helped me most time. I hope you sleep well :)"

I am in the USA and through the decades I've had four different doctors at different times and they all kept me on the meds that I needed for insomnia. This should be the norm for all insomniacs. I feel sorry for the people that don't have access to adequate medical care for insomnia as it can change your life for the best. If I had to live my life everyday with insomnia I would say that that wouldn't be a life worth living. I know because I suffered for 20 years before going on medications and it was a living hell.

I hope you eventually find a good doctor that will provide you with the medications that you need to live a good, successful and happy life."

Ambien tolerance also skyrocketed but didnt leave me feeling too drowsy the day after. Trazodone i believe helped the most with the least amount of side effects. There was another one i had been prescribed that started with a C but i can’t remember the name…made my fucking blood pressure drop so much leading to fainting so fuck that. 

I’m now prescribed 0.5mg xanax 20/month that i use if i have trouble sleeping and it works great. Before that, i was on clonazepam, but the xanax works better personally since it hits a bit harder and doesnt have such a long half-life. Hope you find a solution!"

Benadryl/Diphenhydramine has shown a pretty good success rate when it is cycled (studies seem to indicate that long-term use can potentially lead to issues with dementia...so be aware). Not only does it work well for sleep onset, but I tend to sleep completely through the night.

I generally take microdoses of melatonin with or without the diphenhydramine - studies have found, which I can confirm from experience) that the optimal dose for melatonin's effectiveness is somewhere around 300 micrograms (600 micrograms seems to work best for me). Most formulations you find in retail stores are 3-5 milligrams, which is way too high of a dose - these studies indicated that melatonin's effectiveness works on a bell curve, which peaks around 300 mcg and becomes less effective at doses higher than that.

I have become a fan of Traditional Medicinals Nighty Night Extra herbal tea - I've found that a 3-bag cup about 20 minutes before bedtime makes it easier to enter ""sleep mode"" (it doesn't mitigate my insomnia on its own, but when combined with a sleep aid I notice my sleep onset time to be much closer to optimal)."

6270,h9rbead,,,insomnia,1629524463,"Have you seen a psychiatrist to see if you have depression or bipolar disorder or some other thing that’s interfering with sleep? I had severe insomnia for two years and I had tried a bunch of medicines (I tried mirtazapine, trazodone, quetiapine, gabapentin, clonazepan, ambien, lunesta) but either they wouldn’t work well or I’d become tolerant to the drug after a couple of weeks… actually clonazepan was pretty effective but it’s addictive so I never took it for long. 

A lot of doctors told me I was depressed (that was true) but the antidepressants they gave me like mirtazapine, trazodone and lexapro  didn’t improve my sleep. It’s only when I took a combination of lexapro  and lunesta that I started getting a full 7-8 hours if sleep. It’s lexapro in the morning, and lunesta at night. 
Apparently my depression was messing up my serotonin levels and because of that, I couldn’t stay asleep through the night. And because I hadn’t slept enough, I was depressed. It was a vicious circle of the insomnia and depression feeding each other. Hence why treating both the depression and insomnia with separate drugs worked for me."

6281,h9r10uu,,,insomnia,1629517894,"Trust me, that 6.25mg is more than psychological. Last year I went through a very slow tapering process (6 months) from 50mg. I bought a weighing scale and filed down my pill by 2% - 4% every 2 weeks and made it down to 6.25mg. Any further tapering from 6.25mg produced brutal insomnia. I tried and tried to get lower than 6.25mg for about two weeks to no avail. The insomnia was just too much. I had my doctor put me back to 50 mg to stabilize my sleep and that worked immediately. I probably could go back down to 6.25mg again and it would still be effective, however, after that experience I'm going to stay at 50 mg for a good long while. What I've learned about meds and insomnia over many decades is if a med is working, lower the dose if you can, but it's best to just stay on the lowest dose possible. After all, we are not normal sleepers. We are insomniacs or at least people with fragile sleep systems. I think of sleep meds the same way a diabetic thinks of their insulin."

Everyone else pretty much recognized that apnea had nothing to do with my issues and tried to treat what they saw as the underlying issue(s) in various ways, but *all* of them took me and my statements and experiences seriously. Those were all sleep specialists who were solid but would never have called themselves anything like ""really great in the field,"" but the fact that they *listened to me* and *trusted me* made all the difference (and they did make some successful treatment choices, too - which the ""among the best in the field"" guys immediately said were no longer options because ""that shouldn't work,"" lol). 

As far as I'm concerned ""among the best in the field"" 100% translates into ""I know everything, you mean nothing to me, I will treat what I think is wrong with you and I don't care if that's actually the problem or not because I am Among The Best In The Field and you are Merely A ~~Problem~~ Patient."""

It makes sense. I sometimes struggle with sleep paralysis and when I’m experiencing an episode of sleep paralysis, I notice my breathing is shallow and labored. I almost feel like I’m drowning. I realized this is how I breathe when asleep. No wonder I don’t wake up rested and this is probably the cause of my  insomnia.

 I wouldn’t doubt that sleep apnea worsens or is the cause of your insomnia. My belief is that upper airway resistance syndrome happens prior to sleep apnea and can lead to sleep apnea. You’ve probably had UARS your whole life explaining the insomnia. And the condition has worsened and you now have apnea’s which worsens insomnia."

You are right to be concerned about driving with no sleep. A whole lot of accidents are due to sleep deprivation. I would drink coffee and energy drinks to force me to be alert while driving. Yes, they can make one jittery, but they do increase alertness which you will need.

I don't know what type of sleeping pill you took, but if it frequently is not working then it's time to see your doctor to switch to a different type or a combo to get you back to consistently adequate sleep to feel well both physically and mentally.

6315,h9q4jnj,,,insomnia,1629501898,You are taking too much. You only need 0.3 mg- 2 mg. Taking more won’t really help more and will more likely cause nightmares.
6316,h9q3cg0,,,insomnia,1629501341,"If a person is thirsty and they go a week or so with no water, they will die. If a person has long term, chronic insomnia they are highly likely to develop very serious secondary disease processes that can take or shorten their life. The previous poster is correct that thirst and insomnia are similar....."
6317,h9q1v4k,,,insomnia,1629500648,"According to my sleep specialists, it's definitely possible, even likely, for undiagnosed apnea to contribute to sleep-onset problems. 

(They thought this was my problem, in fact, which is why I know. Then I did a sleep study which showed I don't have apnea, and now they seem kind of bothered at me for not having apnea and therefore making their job harder. Love it.)"
6318,h9q1s51,,,insomnia,1629500610,"Can use a sleeping pill to stop the cycle.

6320,h9q10v3,,,insomnia,1629500252,"I used it ages ago for sleep. It's quite the interesting medication because it didn't give me the horrible drowsiness that other medication does and it worked slightly differently. It moved my sleep cycle to a relatively normal one and the sleep cycle didn't change while on the meds. It's not a knock you immediately out type of medication though and the effects will show a little while after it has built up in your system.

As for side effects, there really weren't any for me. No excessive drowsiness or hunger pangs."
6321,h9q0whg,,,insomnia,1629500196,"Try ""literally thinking your way to better sleep"" when your brain is wracked with anxiety and is not functioning properly due to chronic sleep deprivation. It's literally impossible.

However, the behavior that you mentioned to associate bed with sleep will help some people. But, other people become more woken up and alert if they leave their bed and start doing something and find that staying in bed and relaxing their body is more helpful. It all depends on the individual."
6322,h9q093v,,,insomnia,1629499891,"There are some good sleep podcasts of people reading old boring books.  My favorites are reads by British men.  If you try OTC meds, I find the doxy succinate"
6323,h9pypju,,,insomnia,1629499182,thanks for the response. my boyfriend was in the military also and finds that listening to youtube videos helps him sleep. for me I cannot sleep unless I have complete silence and some type of white noise such as a fan.
6324,h9pyij4,,,insomnia,1629499093,i’ve never had meds or been diagnosed with insomnia but i’m pretty sure that’s what’s going on. I wanted to avoid taking meds but everything else ive tried has had no effect
6325,h9pydf7,,,insomnia,1629499029,"Imbalanced thyroid can cause anxiety. So can cortisol levels if they’re too high or too low (test with saliva cortisol test, not blood or urine)"
6326,h9py6qi,,,insomnia,1629498943,Thanks ! I didn’t know thyroid issues could cause insomnia. I’ll keep that in mind in case nothing else works… In my case I think it is mostly due to anxiety though.
6327,h9pwsrr,,,insomnia,1629498319,Some think limbic system getting stuck in fight or flight is responsible. The perfect storm kinda thing
6328,h9pwawo,,,insomnia,1629498096,"First of all, I should note that a 2012 meta-analysis found that Ambien and other drugs that work along the same lines work partly because of the placebo effect, not because they're actually doing what it says on the label. ([https://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8343](https://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8343) \- original study, [https://www.kqed.org/quest/49411/are-sleeping-aids-effective-or-just-a-placebo-effect](https://www.kqed.org/quest/49411/are-sleeping-aids-effective-or-just-a-placebo-effect) \- report on the study that is actually readable by normal people)

*However*, that's not *necessarily* terrible, because placebos are effective! They just usually come with FAR fewer nasty side effects and don't cause dependency the way Ambien does. (As a side note, drug studies consistently find that placebos are 25-30% effective with chronic conditions, so I think you should be able to tell your doctor ""hey, I'm cool with being prescribed a placebo as my first go-to if the regular treatments have a bunch of side effects,"" because why *not* harness the power of side-effect-free sugar pills? But that's a total side note.) 

If you are taking it, then ABSOLUTELY what u/SparkysJewelry65 said. **Take it** ***when you are already in bed***!!! Do not tempt yourself in any way into staying up, because *that* is when the Bad Ambien Side Effects kick in. (I say this from experience, because when I took ambien and stayed up I would invariably wake with a weird taste in my mouth and empty jars of pepperoncini all over the kitchen.)

And definitely *definitely* do not drink alcohol, smoke pot (or intake it in any other way), or do anything else that might impact its effects.

In my experience it helped me in a very limited way, but I would not want to use it again because it is NOT DESIGNED FOR CHRONIC INSOMNIA. Oh sure, the drug manufacturer will tell you it is, but 1) Your body develops a tolerance pretty quickly, forcing you to higher and higher doses or withdrawal symptoms, and 2) You can get dependent on it pretty quickly as well, and 3) Studies suggest that the quality of sleep you get on ambien is not very good because it is a sedative and suppresses REM sleep, so it's not even going to give you the rest you had with trazodone - article with highlighted passage here: [https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/what-science-says-about-using-sleep-medications#:\~:text=While%20taking%20drugs%20like%20Ambien,and%20forgetfulness%20the%20following%20morning](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/what-science-says-about-using-sleep-medications#:~:text=While%20taking%20drugs%20like%20Ambien,and%20forgetfulness%20the%20following%20morning).

So if your insomnia is recent and not chronic, go for it - for a couple days. For short-term cases, or breaking a cycle, I think it can be very effective. But if it's chronic insomnia that you're suffering from, I would have a very serious conversation with your sleep specialist about why they are putting you on this medication and what their thoughts are about the addiction / dependence issues, as well as their thoughts on the effects of long-term REM-depressed sleep."
6329,h9pwa75,,,insomnia,1629498087,"Same happened to me, never had it in my life and then all of a sudden bang, 4 days of no sleep or little sleep. I was fighting. an earworm for 6 months before that day.   
I was under a lot of anxiety which just blew off and have insomnia since then.

I was taking xanax 2 weeks before my insomnia each day, so that may have contributed to the ailment as well.  


It seems that this kind of pressure caused longterm insomnia for me, previously I was stressed, under pressure, but always fall asleep in 15 minutes max, now need 2-3 hours to fall asleep."

6333,h9pthik,,,insomnia,1629496839,It was stress and our bedroom set up.... after moving country and having black out curtains and a much better sleep routine I sleep like a baby now. Less screen time and cafeine and more exercise has also helped. Best of luck everyone
6334,h9pteyn,,,insomnia,1629496808,"Now that you mention it, it could be blood sugar spiking. I've been eating a lot of protein powder lately, which has stevia. Maybe it's the other components of the powder, but that's about the only change I made in my nutrition before having this issue. It could be that you hit the nail on the head with that question. I would say my state is pretty relaxed when I wake up, but I don't really pay much attention to it."
6335,h9pt50e,,,insomnia,1629496686,"sure, it's a major symptom of sleep apnea:

6338,h9psaxx,,,insomnia,1629496317,"This isn’t a sleep med, but 95% of my insomnia was resolved after I got on liothyronine after I ordered labs for thyroid through ulta Lab Tests. It turned out I had low Free T3 and high Reverse T3. Once I got up to 50mcg per day, I sleep through the night and fall asleep quickly more nights than not. No doctor had ever suspected that I had a thyroid problem since I’m young and look very healthy. I’m also in the mental health field as a psychologist in training and am working on finding the root cause of insomnia for patients when therapy is ineffective, which often involves testing for various hormone levels. The next step for me is to get all my sex hormones tested since those can also cause insomnia if they’re off. I hope this was helpful even if it didn’t quite give you what you’re looking for."
6339,h9ps9gn,,,insomnia,1629496299,"I have been placed on several sleep aid meds since I was in the military and now that I am out. Not sure if you’ve had any prescriptions to help , but some interestingly enough the ones that help me sorta ease into some sleep are Tylenol PM capsules. I’m 29 and have had meds like ambien and hydroxyzine prescribed but did not like the extremely irritable mood or groggy sensation the next day. I recommend trying the Tylenol PM pills , I also put on like scary story narations on YouTube to help my mind imagine the story and eventually drift off to sleep instead of just laying there with my thoughts racing and overthinking the situation of being unable to sleep. Not sure if this is anything for you but maybe worth a try. I understand the frustration when your partner falls asleep instantaneously my ex gf was the same way."
6340,h9prlvb,,,insomnia,1629496011,"Happens to me - usually happens for a few weeks, then stops, then at some random point starts again. I assume it happens for the same reason so many things happen when I start trying to sleep: once I stop focusing on everything that's going on around me, I start noticing all the stuff I've been drowning out by focusing on other things. Sometimes it's intrusive thoughts, sometimes it's stress, sometimes it's physical things like itching or joint pain, and sometimes it's all of the above and more, hurrah! I've always assumed that it is mostly psychological. 

I'm also a princess-on-the-pea kind of sleeper, like as a kid I could not sleep unless the sheets over and under me had absolutely NO wrinkles, so maybe I'm not the right person to be asking or answering."
6341,h9pqzc7,,,insomnia,1629495733,"I have GAD and had terrible insomnia, it got so bad I had sleep dread.  SRT finally cured the onset insomnia and over time as I've addressed the anxiety the maintenance insomnia has improved as well.  All that's left for me is the early morning anxiety when you first wake up.   My psych says that is always the last to go and hardest to overcome.  

I used cymbalta for just about 1.5yrs and it helped with the anxious depression and maybe the anxiety a little too, but it definitely didn't help the insomnia.  Mirtazapine really worked for the anxiety and insomnia but I have bad sides so can't take it."
6342,h9pp2im,,,insomnia,1629494904,"I had this two week period when this first started where I went fully back to normal. No idea what I did differently. Just one night I felt ""normal tired"", and started sleeping fine. Not sure if im the only one, but the tiredness I feel with insomnia is different than when Im not dealing with this. I can just tell Im going to be sleeping bad. Its weird.

But, the fact that I had that good period gives me hope for us. A good nights rest is in there somewhere. But I feel you... sometimes I think ive just lost the ability to sleep well."
6343,h9po8mz,,,insomnia,1629494547,"Been to therapy numerous times. Have major generalised anxiety so insomnia is a major issue with it. Just this light sleep stuff is shit, wake up and feel like I haven't slept at all. :("

Every now and then ill get a few hours of deep sleep at night. But most nights its really light. Ill wake up and wonder if I was even sleeping. The only reason I have anxiety at this point is because of my sleeping issues - and it seems to be whats keeping me up. Horrible cycle."
6346,h9pmug2,,,insomnia,1629493952,"The impacts from sleep deprivation are readily dispelled by sleep.  In that sense it's not dissimilar to thirst.

If you have no underlying med issues, then focusing on overall sleep improvement is the way to go.  Using a CBT sleep training system could give you a comprehensive and permanent solution."
6347,h9pmiuo,,,insomnia,1629493815,"When the kinds of issues you describe become overwhelming, it's most definitely time to reach out for professional help.  Therapy or counseling can help you come to grips with these issues.  There's a number of methods you can use, some completely substance free like cognitive restructuring.  

Short term you can continue to consult with your doc, but longer term you might be helped by using a CBT sleep training system.  CBT won't by itself treat medical or psychiatric issues, but combined with professional care that might give you a comprehensive structure that's a permanent solution.

Hang in there."
6348,h9plxmy,,,insomnia,1629493564,"AKA stimulus control, one of the core methods in a full CBT sleep training system.  Equally if not more important is cognitive restructuring -- literally thinking your way to better sleep.

It makes sense to me logically. Furthermore, being a musician and videographer over the past 15 years, it gives me that creative dopamine i crave so much more immediately than the later mediums and feels so much more fulfilling in hind sight. Due to how miniatures are designed, they're so much easier to create and customize in a fraction of the time and you have immediate access to a community who generally welcomes and praises your work due to the niche.

I have yet to nail down a style, I guess abstract realism?? I like doing graphic art type stuff now and again, like pop/street art type of things. But I kind of default to painting objects in a way that look like things but are more modern impressions, sweeping chunks of paint and whatnot, because I’m too hard on myself (and undisciplined) to do classic landscapes or still lifes. Short answer is heavy textured acrylic paintings. 

I’m going to check out your feed so it may answer my question but what do you like to do in miniature? I love that idea and always think they’re beautiful, because it can take less time but also requires more technical skill. Like editing a letter to be artful but succinct, with paint."

6410,h9n2jac,,,insomnia,1629449906,"I'm aware of what it is lol. i was suggesting to you, maybe you have a circadian disorder such as Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, as you said you can't sleep before 9 a.m. without medicine. some folks have sleep apnea AND circadian disorder such as DSPD.


circadian disorder much more aligned with wake up time than sleep time, but since sleep times are tied usually with wake times in ideal, it rings. 

you definitely get tired on your own still. dspd has a relative stable bed/wake time maybe with a variance of a few hours, even if it's 4 a.m or 6 a.m. or 8 a.m. sleep time. non-24 you rotate around the clock, each day or week. you still get tired on your own there. 

circadian disorders don't circumvent the circadian rhythm, your rhythm can be late/delayed, free-running (in non 24), early/advanced, or irregular sleep/wake times over a consistent period in life. so you still get tired when your rhythm deems it, but other things can cause you to stay awake. sorry I'm rambling, just wanted to inform"

if it quacks &amp; walks like a duck, its probably a duck. 

i aint a doctor but we're on a reddit forum about insomnia with like 2 up votes, so i feel confident tellin this random ass person they have dspd. 

poor sleep associations is one thing. but many many many, in fact the overwhelming majority, of people that sleep with a schedule at or close to what OP has, have DSPD but are misdiagnosed with other disorder or general insomnia.

&amp; if you have a ""normal"" circadian rhythm your body isn't gonna turn itself upside down &amp; sleep from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m (stable hours, another sign of dspd), consistently, which OP has, regardless of your sleep associations. circadian rhythms are relatively stable thru life with some slight variances for the majority of folks, &amp; dspd isn't curable. 

dspd is commonly misdiagnosed insomnia, bad sleep hygiene sleep associations, or whatever else.. they can find a DLMO test or other means to really find out, outside of keepin a sleep journal which is the best and sometimes only way to get diagnosed."

r/dspd

resources aplenty. sleep docs can rule out things like apnea and co. but they will use a sleep journal (try to keep a sleep journal for the next month or two) to diagnose. as the other said, this is mainly for accommodations. doctors and sleep specialists cannot treat circadian rhythm disorders specifically any more than you can help yourself. not to say that they're idiots, but rather, there's only a few things that can impact circadian rhythms &amp; with DSPD specifically, no sleep med will help long term.

its advisable with a circadian disorder, to adjust your life around the disorder. you can't live a full life if you never sleep, or sleep or are fatigued cuz its outside your rhythm. 

but we live in reality lol so..the three main things that are proven to help with circadian disorder are:

1. dark therapy
2. light therapy 
3. melatonin

every person is different, but those 3 things are basically the only things that can help you entrain to an earlier cycle. with DSPD you can expect (if you do have improvement, not everyone does) to move your hours up 1-3 hours, but its a every day thing. 

light therapy at natural wake up time. dark therapy a few hours or so before sleep time. a small dose of melatonin 4-6 hours before your natural sleep time can help advance your rhythm (works much better with light therapy when you wake) . however if you take it to fall asleep only like 30 mins before, it aint help with changing your sleep time, just helps you fall asleep at that moment 

anyway lots of valuable info in that sub and the related links. unfortunately circadian disorders don't have (really only a few) sustainable treatments for the vast majority, which makes sense, as we wouldn't expect a nighttime sleeper to be able to change their schedule without major impact"

if you have a circadian disorder, it is NOT like jet lag. it may feel like it but it aint. you can use light/dark therapy and melatonin to entrain to a 2-3 hour difference in sleep, but no you can't just ""set your preferred wake up time"" - if it's outside your natural sleep/wake time you won't feel rested &amp; your body naturally will inch towards the natural rhythm. 

not every case of insomnia is simple &amp; circadian rhythm do not just reset. you have a rhythm and it stays, for the most part, the same most of your life."

In practice, if you can find a way to reduce your sleep deprivation (ie, find a way to sleep), your thought inhibition impairment will go away. I always thought all my life it was a characteristic of my personality, but I discovered it was only caused by sleep deprivation.

I too have never been able to fall asleep whenever I wanted like most people. But I do have a good quality sleep. Falling asleep is the real problem. Maintaining a daily sleep schedule helps me (circadian rhythm) . But sometimes due to heightened anxiety it gets messed up anyway. I am currently using Clonotril 0.5 for my anxiety. From your description it doesn't look like you have an anxiety problem just an upturned circadian rhythm. Try to form a habit and it should help. Also seek a doctor if problem persists.

You don't necessarily need to see a sleep specialist.  Start with your doc to either treat or rule out an underlying med issue.  If none -- which is most common -- then you likely have primary insomnia.  For that the standard of care is use of a CBT sleep training system, which may give you a permanent and substance free solution.

6530,h9kb1yo,,,insomnia,1629397851,"Cardio isn't good for sleep for several reasons, and one of the lesser-known ones is that it heats your brain up. Your brain needs to cool down a couple of degrees for restful, deep sleep to occur. So this is slightly off-topic, but many evenings--especially if I run after 6:00 or so, I'll either place a cold pack wrapped in a pillowcase under my head, or I'll run a stream of cold water over my head for several minutes. Helps a lot.

Cardio also makes your body release epinephrine (a.k.a. adrenaline) and dopamine and some other energizing, feel-good chemicals. I don't know what effect those other things have on sleep, but epinephrine keeps you awake. So odds are, if you do cardio in the middle of the night, it might make you *feel* a lot better about not being able to sleep, but it's unlikely to help you sleep.

The only caveat is that *anxiety* about not being able to sleep is one of the main drivers of insomnia. It's a cycle. So if you *enjoy* doing cardio in the middle of the night, it might change your relationship with insomnia to a more positive one. If you wake up at 2 AM and think, ""Well, I guess I'll get a workout in!"" you'll probably be dog-tired the next evening. But if you do it repeatedly and it reduces your anxiety about not sleeping well, it could actually help you sleep better.

Best wishes! Hope this helps."

Simply set and keep your preferred wake time every day, without sleeping in or napping later.  Over the course of several weeks that should reset your body clock.  You'll then begin to feel drowsy enough for sleep roughly 15-17 hours later."
6535,h9k89vq,,,insomnia,1629396670,"The good news here is that you've identified the underlying cause.  That puts you ahead.

By identifying those and learning to let them go, your stress/anxiety levels should go down, and your sleep improve.

There may be other issues as well, such as bad sleep habits, which are very common.  If you want a full substance-free solution for better sleep, use a CBT sleep training system.  Ask your doc or therapist if that might be right for you."

Having your heart rate go down so fast is actually more harmful than not. Cardio is usually recommended early in the morning but never close to bedtime

I answered specifically to OP's question, asking whether insomnia could be caused by anxiety, which is what the whole secondary vs primary disorder is all about. I made no claim that anxiety could not worsen insomnia (although i personally remain unconvinced by the evidence about the significance of this interaction, there are factors that for sure interact with sleep but remain minor, eg exercise).

I agree that given the current state of knowledge, both insomnia and anxiety when present should be independently treated.

Your logical fallacy is lazy. It's a conclusion in search of an explanation, so that's about as much effort as it deserves.

The that insomnia may be a primary disorder in itself does not demonstrate non-causality of anxiety. That should be easy to grasp given that anxiety in itself can be a primary disorder, without insomnia as the antecedent. Insomnia being a primary disorder does not mean that anxiety cannot exacerbate insomnia. The literature you shared suggests is that it may be insufficient to treat anxiety as a means to significantly alleviate insomnia. 

It's easy to find literature suggesting a bidirectional relationship:

""Evidence suggests that there is a bidirectional relationship between, on one hand, anxiety and depression and, on the other hand, insomnia. This suggests that anxiety, depression, and insomnia are intertwined over time, implying implications for theoretical conceptualizations and interventions."" -- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022399907004114

""While anxiety seems to play a key role in the development of insomnia, depression may be considered as a possible precipitating mechanism but even more likely as a consequence of insomnia."" -- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14768320500129015

""There is an intriguing interrelationship between anxiety and depression, and insomnia. Both depression and anxiety are related to future insomnia, and insomnia can lead to depression and anxiety in the future.120 Of note, the research on such relationships is crucial not only because it may help to prevent future conditions but also because comorbid problems are usually much more difficult to treat and indicate poorer prognosis."" -- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.14170

https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2012/09000/The_Bidirectional_Association_Between_Depression.14.aspx

6546,h9jpi4w,,,insomnia,1629388948,"Do GPs prescribe where you are? One GP used to prescribe them for occasional anxiety and severe muscle cramps without any issues, but he moved on. The next one had a personal policy against it because of their addictive nature and I felt like an “addict” just for asking (but other than that she was excellent). My next GP was similar but would give me two tablets if I asked. I have a friend whose GP seems to give them to her like lollies. 

I never felt they were addictive though because, unless I was at peak anxiety/cramp (and my other methods hadn’t worked), they just made me feel more tired and gave me a crappy “hangover”, which made everything worse. 

The low dose antidepressant that helped me was amitriptyline. Different family to seroquel. Took a tab at 7.30pm, gloriously tired at about 930, decent sleep from 10-7, bit groggy in the morning fixed by a coffee. Sleep was a brilliant bonus effect to dealing with pain. When the pain started to break through, I increased the dose and though I still slept, it made me constantly tired and the pain continued to breakthrough. Had to change medication.

The problem now is that they’re no longer effective for insomnia, so my sleep is worse than ever. Your dr is probably trying to prevent this from happening to you. I’m at a loss at this point as to what to do because I’m afraid to even try to wean off the benzos, but I wish I hadn’t gotten to this point.

However, I find that anxiety is less just knowing I have some effective pills that I can take whenever insomnia becomes too unbearable. IMO, this actually makes the periods of insomnia slightly better, or at least more tolerable.

Perhaps you can convince her to give you a small prescription. Then, just take them only when it's absolutely necessary. Knowing that you have that option, might make you actually need them less. Something like 60 pills a year should not cause a problem with addiction, but might allow you relief both physically and mentally."

If you're going through a bout of insomnia, chances are not much stuff can really help it anyway. It will pass with time.

6569,h9j9ahf,,,insomnia,1629382205,"to the downvoters i'm actually serious I've had really bad insomnia related to health issues and trauma i would not sleep at all or at most 2-3 hours. it's insane. I would say dealing with trauma/decreasing stress has made a significant impact though it can take a few years. Also I have heard of people with bipolar having thyroid issues as well which if it hasn't been investigated is really important to investigate bc thyroid fluctuations can cause mood shifts/insomnia etc. As I said, I obviously don't know if it's the case, but I'm mentioning it on the off chance that it could be helpful"

And her suggestion was Seroquel. I've had bad experiences with anti-psychotics for sleep issues in the past. She's aware of that."
6574,h9izz0q,,,insomnia,1629377807,"Even most insomniacs from my experience have not done a sleep study, not a stupid question at all. You can try this guy's solution if you want OP \^\^

But I personally don't recommend it. Although sleep deprivation has made you sensitive to things like noise, and removing all these stressors will help sleep— if you can't sleep then you should get out of bed.

By eliminating all lights, it's hard to regulate your circadian rhythm. It also affects your sleep associations negatively, which is a big part of your insomnia. I believe this since you described how the new environment when sleeping at the hospital was so unbearable. It's because of your poor sleep association.

A big part in overcoming insomnia is not just getting one possible night's sleep, but sacrificing a few days to a week's sleep doing sleep restriction and gradually working yourself up to sleep again in the long-term."

6578,h9irwxj,,,insomnia,1629373183,"I've been through this too. Hospitals are horrible, I can never sleep in them and it seems as soon as you sleep they wake youfor nonsense. They are also very loud, bright places.

It could be helpful to talk to a doctor, but also helpful to do things that relax you for a while before bed. Deep breathing, listening to water or nature sounds, imagining peaceful landscapes, or even listening to an audiobook. You could also try ASMR, different sounds to see if any relax you. For me earbuds to block out sounds, and an eye mask to block out light.  Perhaps avoid screens as much as possible for a few hours before bed. 

Some calming tea like chamomile, lemon balm, hibiscus, hops, or skull cap could be helpful. Check to make sure any supplements you try don't interact with your medicine from the doctor. You can google them with the word ""contraindications"" and the herb to make sure, or check RXlist website.

Melatonin can cause heart palpitations, so if you're having them, stop taking that. Finally, talk to a doctor if you can an explain to them what happened. Tell them you haven't slept. They can prescribe something short term for a week or two to get your circadian rhythm back in balance. You can get through this! If you sit in a dark room, without sound or light, and breathe very deep for several minutes, imagining something peaceful, put a cold cloth over your eyes, or even humming it can help with panic."
6579,h9ipljo,,,insomnia,1629371622,"Sorry to hear about your horrible insomnia. I’m currently not doing well with it myself. 

I used to take a low dose antidepressant to manage pain from nerve damage (10-20mg vs 150mg for depression treatment) and I had 6/7 decent nights of sleep rather than the other way around. Unfortunately I had to change treatment after about 5 years and the sleep benefit went too. 

Benzos may be a good short term treatment but unlikely to be prescribed for a long term problem because of how addictive they are. 

Which med is she prescribing? Someone here might have a helpful experience to share?

I was on Seroquel and Clonazepam. Coming off Clonazepam (i didn't take it every day) i got very bad insomnia. Coming off Seroquel was an absolute nightmare. I could sleep for 3 weeks, all I was getting were micronaps.

I absolutely do NOT want to be on any sleep medication. But at the same time I'm a bit desperate as I'm often sleeping 2 hours a night.

It was just really hard for me to understand how CBT could possibly help with sleep maintenance insomnia but I admit that I'm ignorant about it (although I have had CBT for depression before - worse than useless for me).

I've taken trazadone for extended periods at different points, doesn't seem to leave you groggy in morn.  But it's not as strong as seroquel imo.

But in the meantime I definitely would reccomend trying guided meditations if you haven't already. Wear headphones, sounds better and also nobody else can hear it. 

These don't always put me to sleep, but at least I can spend the time awake chilling and letting my body rest instead of absolutely fuming.

The Honest Guys are on YouTube and Spotify, they have meditations for different moods and things like releasing anger. They also do sleep stories.

Jason Stephenson is on both, he does sleep stories and positive affirmations - also music for sleep so full disclosure it can be a bit of a mish to look through those and piss you off even more.

Michael Sealey is on both, he does hypnosis-style ones. 

Christian Thomas does my favorite sleep stories (search his name on spotify or look up Meditation Vacation on You tube).  

If you prefer a female voice ""Relax for a while"" does sleep stories and I think other meditations too on YouTube - also comforting words and ASMR videos if you like those."

6618,h9hjamk,,,insomnia,1629341003,"&gt; Obviously, interventions for PTSD involve treating comorbid depression (Bryant &amp; Harvey, 2000) and when treating substance abuse that occurs in the presence of **an anxiety disorder**, the intervention targets the substance use and **the anxiety** (Beeder &amp; Millman, 1996). Taken together, **the precedent set by comorbidity between other psychological disorders does not provide a mandate for regarding insomnia as ‘secondary’ on the basis of comorbidity.**
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; A robust finding in the literature is that sleep disturbance precedes the development of depression. [...] Further, other studies have found that insomnia also precedes the development of anxiety disorder (Breslau et al., 1997; Ford &amp; Kamerow, 1989) and alcohol abuse (Weissman, Greenwald, Nino-Murcia, &amp; Dement, 1997). Taken together, if the disorder that develops first and heralds in the second disorder is a marker of a ‘primary’ disorder, it would appear that there is little reason to regard insomnia as the ‘secondary’ disorder. **On the contrary, insomnia is a clear antecedent to the development of depression and a likely antecedent to the development of anxiety and alcohol abuse.**
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; It is widely held that ‘The first step toward insomnia management is a correct diagnosis and treatment of possible underlying or concomitant conditions, especially those of a psychiatric nature’ (Lopez-Ibor, 1996, p. 33). In other words, **if the ‘primary’ disorder is targeted in treatment, it is assumed that the insomnia will remit. There are several studies indicating this not to be the case.**
&gt; 
&gt; [...]

And the author Harvey even wrote a nice summary at some point:

&gt; **Contrary to the widely held belief, insomnia was not found to be ‘secondary’ in that (1) it develops first, (2) it can be treated without concurrent treatment of the comorbid disorder, and in the sense that (3) it is a risk (potentially causal) factor for the development of the comorbid disorder.**

All these excerpts come from just [the second ref](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-7358(00)00083-0) I provided above, which was aptly named: ""INSOMNIA: SYMPTOM OR DIAGNOSIS?""

The other papers, which are more recent, provide the same view and more recent evidence, stating explicitly that in view of all these evidences, insomnia should always be treated independently from other comorbid psychological disorders. Especially since treating the comorbid disorders usually (never?) resolve the insomnia disorder.

6623,h9hdudg,,,insomnia,1629338331,"...have you considered melatonin? It's an over-the-counter drug that your body produces on its own, anyway. You're supposed to take a few milligrams at like 30 minutes before you want to sleep. People like to balk at it, and say that it doesn't work because maybe it didn't work the very first time they tried it. Which is what I did to my doctor; he told me I have to give it like 10 nights. He was totally right... I'm a chronic non-sleeper, accidentally going about 3 days at a time without sleeping, sometimes. Melatonin truly does help, especially when you've formed it as a habit.

Another thing that I've heard sleep experts recommend many times, is to get out of bed if you've been laying there for like 30 minutes and still haven't gone to sleep. You start to associate your bed with non-sleep activities. They say to get out of bed, go sit somewhere else and read a book for a while. For someone like me though, I will end up staying up all night on accident. Forming a decent habit around having a night time ritual is what has really helped me, along with the melatonin."
6624,h9hd8fb,,,insomnia,1629338035,"Have you tried to quit every medication and then sleep to see how it is going without them, you seem to be had lots of pills for sleep and maybe it broke your sleep from too much so you might just try to quit everything, it sounds retarded but finding a natural way to sleep is better than medicine and that's what I'm trying to do, it is hard but hopefully would work. Did quitting kratom gives you sleep troubles as side effects?"
6625,h9hclvn,,,insomnia,1629337735,Yeah that’s not normal. And stuff like that doesn’t happen unless you’re of old age or have had really bad habits for a long time. You got nothing to worry about
6626,h9hbkws,,,insomnia,1629337254,Dementia?
6627,h9ha7ej,,,insomnia,1629336603,Ambien worked for me for years. I liked the way Ambien help me sleep. I tried Lunesta but did not care much for it. I may try it again in the future.
6628,h9h9qda,,,insomnia,1629336376,"Dementia in ER caused by the aberrant and forced sleep pattern/sleep deprivation (eg, as you said, the nurses and doctors don't care when you sleep, they will wake you up for any reason in regards to their duties) is a serious issue that is actively being studied. So you are not alone.

There is no fix afterward other than patiently waiting and doing your best to sleep any opportunity you get. You need rest.

If your depression gets too bad, seek a psychiatrist to manage that with drugs until you get enough rest to be more stable. You seem to have a good grip on yourself but be careful, we are all the products of our biology, when the biology goes wrong, it can make us do irreversible mistakes...

I hope it will get better for you."
6629,h9h8pg7,,,insomnia,1629335890,"First, protect your job.  If you are in the US and have been working for the same employer for a year then you can get intermittent FMLA, just tell your employer you need to apply for FMLA and then meet with your Dr to fill it out for intermittent leave (you'll still have to use any paid time off but it protects you from being disciplined against for missing time related to the reason for FMLA.   Up to 12 weeks worth of full time work are protected (unpaid if you run out of PTO) and do not have to be taken all at once, you can take a day here and there as needed (intermittent).   Other countries have different ways of protecting employment or income for people who get sick or disabled and IMO insomnia fits the bill. 

Next, talk with your Dr about options for treating the insomnia immediately. Personally I'm at the not ideal point of medication most every night but just knowing I have meds that I can take if I need to sometimes lets me relax enough that I end up not needing to take them: it reduces my anxiety about sleep just to know I have options.  Start with melatonin, then if that doesn't work go to Trazadone if you have depression or Hydroxyzine if not, finally ending up with Ambien, rozerem, Lunesta et al if all else fails. 

While doing this, examine your sleep hygiene and see if you can make improvements there and explore cognitive-behavioral therapy/sleep restriction.  That tends to be a longer term but more sustainable fix so I suggest the quick fixes first so your life doesnt blow up while you work on the big picture. 

A sleep study may be helpful to figure out if your sleep is really as disrupted as you think it is (many times I think I slept less than an hour but my fitbit will tell me it was 5 hours, which is reassuring although aggravating) AND if there is anything you can do to improve your sleep quality.  Sleep apnea, restless legs, etc can mess up the sleep you do get and there are treatments available.

Finally, get into counseling, specifically cognitive-behavioral.  Learning mindfulness skills helps with both coping with the effects of insomnia and to promote sleep in the first place.  A lot of insomnia is a symptom of anxiety so if you treat the anxiety, insomnia may improve.  At the very least, insomnia is emotionally distressing and the effects it has on our lives can be severe so counseling just to deal with the aftermath and trauma is useful. 

Advanced tip: if you have a partner and can at all swing it, sleep in separate bedrooms."
6630,h9h7xnu,,,insomnia,1629335532,"So, my body is kinda retarded. Some of the sleep meds will work for a week or two and just stop (mirtazapine, seroquel, trazadone, any benzos at low dosage, higher dosage benzos always put me to sleep, along with high levela of ambien).

The only benzo that I can pop back to back to back and not feel anything is Ativan. To me it doesn't do anything. Some of the other ones that haven't helped are flerixirl, belsomra, and a handful of other ones I can't remember the names of. Anything OTC doesn't work; calms Forte, melatonin, zzzquil, things like that.

I don't drink any caffeine at all during the day. My biggest change I'veade recently was quitting kratom cold turkey, and I used high dosages of it for sedation and mood improvements, but unfortunately I got to close to the proverbial fire and burnt myself abusing kratom. Now I'm going through withdrawals. Was spending $100 a day on kratom. Still debating if it's worth it. Without it I feel like a empty shell.

6635,h9gz97o,,,insomnia,1629331467,"i don't have a psychiatrist or therapist yet, but i have been thinking about getting one. this fear is one that's been on/off for at least 3 years now. it'll disappear for a few months and then hit me like a train and i have to deal with it again for a few weeks. it started back up again recently so i figured I'd see if other people had this problem too."
6636,h9gw6o5,,,insomnia,1629329991,"I'm afraid being put on sleep meds because I don't want to rely on them. Do you think that the medicine you've been given to take is actually helping or it's only making you dependent on them, like disturbing your natural sleep without meds. Have you ever got a good night sleep without them or for a period of time?"
6637,h9gujv8,,,insomnia,1629329208,"I agree. I managed to learn to relax and fall asleep within a reasonable time and get a full night's sleep after many years of insomnia. However, I continued to wake up and feel exhausted, dizzy and nauseous in the morning and couldn't understand why. I even got a referral to a sleep analysis but they couldn't find any cause and I was told that it's ""probably just anxiety"". But I had learned to relax and didn't feel anxious in the evening. So what gives?

After reading up on it, I learned that stress and anxiety could still affect my sleep quality. Shutting off my brain as I went to bed didn't make the anxiety go away. It remained on a subconscious level as you put it and continued to wreck my sleep."
6638,h9gtwuf,,,insomnia,1629328904,"Thank you so much for the great advice.  I slept 4 hours last night and was in survival mode today.  This new job is stressful and i am learning all new things.  Like adding fuel to the fire right now.

My pdoc sent me an email and recommended i go to impatient to get stable.  If i do that i will most likely have to give up my job.  That in itself stresses the heck out of me so i am just taking one day at a time.  If i have a night where i dont sleep again i may just go right to impatient.  Appreciate your support and help!"
6639,h9gsbsi,,,insomnia,1629328161,"I distract myself with music or podcasts. Something fairly monotonous that's not too exciting but not too boring either, like documentaries and long-form interviews.

A low dose of CBD also helps calm both my body and mind. I prefer it over knocking myself out with sleep medication."
6640,h9gol0w,,,insomnia,1629326423,"Mental health like anxiety and mood, etc can be effected by lack of sleep.  The physical symptoms you describe sounds like high anxiety accompanied by restlessness.  Behavioral strategies and learning to challenge negative thoughts and responses to your lack of sleep.  

Sleep drugs can help you in the short term, you and your doctor would have to decide if you should be on them longer term due to long term health risks....the benefit for you would have to out weight health risks in other words."
6641,h9gmjn7,,,insomnia,1629325485,"Aside from your negative comments at the end, I agree with you. If I'm actually sleepy cbut can't relax enough to fall asleep, I try to create a dream. I imagine going to the beach or doing something nice. If I'm in that tired but can't fall asleep place then it works in minutes. 

But if I'm wide awake it's just a nice relaxing day dream. Even if you can't sleep, you can still rest your mind and body"
6642,h9glthy,,,insomnia,1629325150,That is what I'm doing now. I started with half caff but that still have me a headache... So now I'm just replacing a bit.

6650,h9gbc59,,,insomnia,1629320303,"You still haven't told me what you do to manage your insomnia.

Femur fractures and cerebral hemorrhage in old people? What age range do you consider ""old people""? I turn 69 tomorrow. After a night of sleep meds to get my required sleep I ride motorcycles which require fast reflexes and good balance. I also still train as a boxer which is very hard at any age. I can still run most 25 year olds out of the ring. I have been doing these things for decades. And no, I don't think I'm a special case. I think most older folks could do what I do if they wanted to. My father didn't stop riding motorcycles until he was 80 due to spinal stenosis.

What I have found in my long history of insomnia is that medical doctors know virtually nothing about insomnia. They are basically agents for the pharmaceutical companies and prescribe medications for insomnia. This also includes the so-called ""sleep specialist MD's"". However, the good thing is that many of the prescription medications actually do work. I discovered this over 31 years ago when I was hospitalized for insomnia. The meds saved me and enabled me to have a happy and successful life. If meds had never been introduced into my life I honestly believe that I would be dead or living on the street.

BTW, I am curious. Specifically, what type of doctor are you?"
6651,h9gb57p,,,insomnia,1629320216,"Yes, of course. Benzos can help with the anxiety, though sleep anxiety is probably the one area where I'd recommend a cognitive-behavioral approach like CBT-i."
6652,h9gaxnn,,,insomnia,1629320120,"I had very serious sleep issues plaguing many days between 2006-2009, I think I must of unconsciously fought with the Antihistamine  and the sleep hygiene was bollocks when the tossing and turning is all mental you see. 

It was Parkinson's interviews that helped me the most definitely, the Kenneth Williams and Maggie Smith 70s deep dives just give you an imagination that you can find anything in, the treasure of sleep was there to take as well."
6653,h9ga98z,,,insomnia,1629319813,"It's only been a couple of weeks. I wouldn't worry about it, yet. You could take some Benadryl if you want something to help you sleep. Your sleep will probably improve over time.

6661,h9g3v7u,,,insomnia,1629316974,"have you talked to a psychiatrist yet? there are lots of meds you can try if this is a chronic issue. you might also ask if you can get a short-term script for a benzo to help with the anxiety as you work your way through this. ideally, for a long-term solution, you should also see a sleep therapist. 

hang in there. it will get better."
6662,h9g3i47,,,insomnia,1629316812,"Wish I could, but I am no doctor. Hell, idek what triggered mine back in college. It has gotten worse in the past 3 years, but I'm pretty sure that has something to do with the things I saw from being a cop and also working security in a hospital (lots of suicide, dead kids/babies, freak accidents, not being able to save people and watching them die, etc). 

My best advice would be to start off going to your GP. She might be able to give you something for sleep (trazadone, ambien, Ativan, belsomra, etc.). If your GP won't, and she doesn't give you any good info on how to handle it, you might want to look into a psychiatrist or maybe even a therapist.

If those don't work, then I'd recommend going to a sleep specialist. They'll be able to work with you and try to find a medication and a daily routine to try and get your sleep back on track.

Personally, that's the route I have taken. Not to be discouraging, but I've been on 10+ different medications, and tried a bunch of OTC sleep meds, but nothing sticks. Only thing that works for me is at minimum 20mgs of ambien (which is kind of a lot), but even then it doesn't always put me to sleep.

Also, apparently there are psychiatrist that specializes in sleep study, so I have an appointment with them in October.

Insomnia sucks man. It has really ruined my life. A good night of sleep for me is 3.5-4 hours. Typically though I'm usually up for 48 hours before I can fall asleep for a little bit.

Definitely get it taken care of asap. You need an adequate amount of sleep to function, and I wouldn't want you (or anyone else) to go through it.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
6663,h9g2wra,,,insomnia,1629316549,"You can get to sleep, I know it. One of the biggest impediments when it comes to rest is ourselves. It's easy to attribute outside causes, but it's usually how we process and strengthen those outside forces that cause them to be bigger, more threatening monsters than what they really are(obviously not always the case when certain situations are very dangerous and threatening but talking about generalized anxiety/stress). Like wondering about work or other stressful situations of that type. But in turn, this can create a hellish insomnia monster that is in fact very real and very difficult to cope with. I always got in my way, and still do honestly.

It seems like from your description that your sleep schedule might be kind of erratic and not at a set pattern. Sticking to a pattern with a practice like sleep restriction could help consolidate your sleep hours and build up your sleep drive. At any rate, though, I would totally seek some help from a licensed CBT-I specialist if you want to go the non-medicine route. It helped me a lot by giving coping mechanisms and points of reference to help through difficult times. &lt;3

I'm not sure what your job is, but if it's anything that could endanger you without proper sleep(ie. trucking or operating construction equipment, etc.), hopefully, you can reach out to a professional for help for the sake of you and your loved ones. It's not a quick fix and varies from person to person on what's effective, but here are some resources to check out that may be helpful: [https://insomniasos.net/](https://insomniasos.net/)."

It’s so very easy to think that taking pills will fix your sleep.  Pills are merely a tool.  You’d ideally want to not become dependent on them for life, although there is testimony here I’ve seen up to 68–70 year olds using them decades.  There’s long term health risks no matter if it’s acknowledged by the user(s) or not.  I was a longer term user of trazodone, my story of years use on this medication isn’t with the best outcome after I discontinued.  

Reasearch and educate yourself is the best advise, okay to be skeptical.

“How Sleep Restriction Therapy Works
Sleep restriction therapy is a common feature of virtually all types of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBTi). It aims to address difficulty staying asleep through reverse logic. Limiting the amount of time spent in bed can actually help those struggling with sleeplessness to sleep better.

This sounds strange, right? Read on to learn about sleep restriction therapy, how to utilize this method, and how it helps treat insomnia.
What is Sleep Restriction Therapy?

It was developed by Dr. Arthur Spielman a neurologist and specialist in sleep medicine from New York. Since then, decades of sleep research have proven it to be the most effective technique for improving sleep. It is considered a reliable treatment method for those with insomnia, and for anyone who is simply trying to sleep better.

The name of this method may be confusing because the goal is not to restrict sleep, but rather to restrict time spent in bed awake. The main concept is that the more time insomniacs spend in bed, the less time they spend asleep. Sleep restriction is designed to correct this imbalance.”

6673,h9fwxyn,,,insomnia,1629313873,"I can fall asleep but I can't maintain the sleep.. I randomly wake up after 2.5 - 3 hours and I fall asleep again after like one hour of trying and then I sleep interrupted, like waking up every one or two hours until the morning so I'm not refreshed at all and I feel tired it's like I didn't sleep."
6674,h9fwrlg,,,insomnia,1629313794,"There's actually some pretty decent decaf out there, would definitely recommend."
6675,h9fwmhb,,,insomnia,1629313729,"No, I haven't found it helpful at all, actually. All it did was sensitize me to caffeine. But that doesn't mean it might not prove helpful for you."
6676,h9fvez3,,,insomnia,1629313183,"Stop sleeping during the day for starters.  That's in effect stealing sleep from the night when you want it.

Use wake time as your zeitgeber, keep it consistent without sleeping in or napping later.  That alone, if sustained over time, almost guarantees better sleep."
6677,h9fv68h,,,insomnia,1629313073,"The fact that you're not tired suggests you're actually sleeping, and a lot more than you think you are.  Sleep state misperception is very common.  

Sometimes the best thing to do is just let go the worry best you can."
6678,h9fv5kp,,,insomnia,1629313064,"Hey, I'm 20 and I'm experiencing some sleep troubles for the past couples of days :/ Had also insomnia 2 years ago and it was pretty bad. Could you tell me why you have chronic insomnia or what triggered it?"
6679,h9fplfp,,,insomnia,1629310561,"Yes, I struggle with this as well. It’s so awful. The more exhausted you are, the more miserable trying to sleep becomes. When I’m that extremely over-tired, I get this sense of dread almost, knowing how miserable those nights usually are.

Unfortunately I have not found any repeatably successful remedies. Sometimes getting up and getting an ice cold drink of electrolytes (I have these electrolyte packets I mix in ice-water that I like, but any sports drink, Gatorade etc) a few times throughout the first few hours seems to help calm me down somewhat?

I’m sorry you have to go through this, I know how terrible it is."
6680,h9fo7xj,,,insomnia,1629309948,"Please find a good CBTi (insomnia CBT) or ACT therapist. They can help you stop this vicious cycle. Don't waste more time trying to do this on your own.

6686,h9fh7x7,,,insomnia,1629306861,"Ok. The consistency will help, but even so night shift can be hard to deal with. Try investing in a SAD lamp, they're inexpensive. Use it when you get up for 15 min."
6687,h9fggkk,,,insomnia,1629306526,"It is 5 days a week of consistent night shifts from 11 pm to 9:30 AM. I get home around 11-12 because I live far from my job and I have to eat and sleep as soon as possible to function the next day. I end up just living by taking small naps in the car throughout the day maybe 2 to 3 hours at a time. I used to be 9n ambien and it worked wonders but was taken off and put on trazadone which knocks me out but also for the day after, and I work around heavy machinery so I really can't risk falling asleep. Sorry for the novel!"

6700,h9fa8p0,,,insomnia,1629303790,"The thing thrt is wrong is that there is absolutely no evidence these therapies are applicable for the circadian rhythm. They were designed for insomnia (and the evidence supporting their use is already shaky for this purpose), but there is nothing for circadian rhythm shifting.

The metric to know if a therapy can shift the circadian rhythm is whether it can modify core body temperature. Not skin temperature, not sleep patterns, not anxiety levels. That's because the master clock in the brain synchronizes local circadirn clocks in cells throughout the body via core body temperature modulations, that's how the signal is propagated far and wide.

None of these therapies have demonstrated an ability to do that.

There are only a few therrpies thrt currently shown they do: bright light and dark therapy, melatonin, and to a lesser extent muscle contraction (physical exercise), food intake, caffeine, alcohol, and a few other drugs."
6701,h9fa89b,,,insomnia,1629303785,"Yeah they do say that absolutely everybody wakes up a few times a night but most go back to sleep so quickly that they don't even remember it.

6702,h9f9zxv,,,insomnia,1629303683,"Thanks, i can understand how some of these things would help with an inability to fall asleep. Just not so sure how they would work for sleep maintenance.

You won't be able to go to bed ""early"" if you're far out of sync, so just stay up until you have enough sleep pressure. In your case, it would mean reduced sleep time in the interim. Get some bright light exposure from the sun when you get up, and during the day - this helps you shift more rapidly.

The distorted negative thinking raises your stress and anxiety and consequently hurts your sleep. You can recover, you can keep a job, and you can lead a healthy life. Not to say it's easy, but you're capable of better sleep."

6721,h9ezzpu,,,insomnia,1629299198,"CBT-i is probably what was intended, i.e. CBT for insomnia. Alongside the CBT exercises it implements sleep restriction therapy, which helps consolidate sleep. This means you would get up at a consistent time in the morning, and limit your total time in bed to less than 8h to start with (you could try 6.5h, then gradually bring it back to 8). There are other things to try listed [here](https://insomniasos.net/). Diet, stress, thermo-comfort, seeping light from outside can have an impact on maintenance."
6722,h9ezdna,,,insomnia,1629298916,"The long naps aren't doing you any favors certainly. I would limit daytime rest to 5-10 minutes. If you get up at 7 am, you'd want to be in bed around 11 pm at the earliest, though if restricting to less than 8h on a temporary basis you could do midnight. Going to bed at 2:30 am only leaves you 4.5 hours in bed if you get up at 7, which isn't enough.

Also endeavor to mitigate factors which can delay onset time. The ""night"" mode helps on devices, but you could give yourself at least an hour period before bed away from any blue light emitting electronics, instead prepping for the next day and doing some reading. 

Do some light yoga and breathing exercises, regular walks, etc to lower your stress levels and remember that the most important aspect of CBT-i is the CBT itself, so do the exercises."

6737,h9erth7,,,insomnia,1629295362,They provide a lot of interesting data about your sleep. They’re critical if you have something like sleep apnea. The other likely conclusion is that your sleep architecture is just fine so you need other things like CBT.

I tried all the meds and they didn't make much of a difference but zinc and magnesium seem to help (though I have celiac so maybe am legit deficient). Also PTSD can legit keep you awake as well. If she is awake with lots of bad memories/worries/etc going around in her head that is a serious problem that needs to be addressed as much as possible in the day time so that these issues don't come out to haunt at night etc...

The only thing that I can take and actually use is klonopin, bug I have to take 6-7mg of it before it puts me to sleep, and I only get one refill a month, so I don't get many uses from that. Maybe see if her Dr can try her out on a benzo, like ativan, Xanax, Valium, klonopin, etc.

She also said it was exhausting to observe. They never mentioned it was sleep apnoea or remarked that I snored. To be fair, sleep studies are super disruptive and distracting…

I had the same issues as you except I would take up to an hour to fall asleep, and *everything* would wake me up. I spent a couple of years straight up wearing a sleep mask and those putty earplugs you use for swimming because the regular ones would fuck up and infect my ears after a week of use. Wound up impacting my ear wax in the process, so I was grumpy, exhausted and deaf in one ear. I would get sick every week because my immune system was *fucked*, my hands always shook, my eyes would twitch, and I was incomprehensible in the afternoons at work which resulted in me being super antisocial when I was fairly social (albeit an introvert) in the past.

I also had frequent nightmares - mostly arguing with my abusive mum or being tormented by scary, violent women. The main thing with my nightmares was that I was actually acting them out, yelling and hitting my partner in my sleep (am a very petite woman, so I didn't do any damage luckily) so it was kind of like the opposite of night terrors.  I also woke up drenched in sweat quite often. 

They thought it might be REM Behaviour Disorder, but an MRI ruled out any funny business in my noggin' so coupled with those nightmares raised above, they settled on some form of PTSD combined with the anxiety disorder I'd already been diagnosed with and after five gruelling years of seeking treatment I was eventually enlisted with a sleep psychiatrist (who I still see to this day and is very invested in helping me), and put on mirtazapine. 

Worked like a charm, but I gained 12+ kilos in the process (which is a lot of weight for me - I'm about 148cm and was 40-42kg). Somewhere down the line though, he also diagnosed me with ADHD and I was put on a non-stimulant, but it resulted in me losing roughly 4 kilos but I think I'm happier at this weight."

But it's also a benzo, which are highly abused in the US, so don't be discouraged if your Dr doesn't prescribe you klonopin (or any benzo). I didn't get put on it until 2018, and I had been going through and trying different prescribed meds since 2010ish (give or take).

As for Delta 8, you can find it at pretty much any smoke shop/vape shop/headshop. Just be careful if you get the vape kind.

- Sleep study: because insomnia can be caused by OSAS or temporal epilepsy. 

- CBT

- BZ or Z-compounds: only when needed, with minimum effective dose as giudlines says (that is 5mg of ambien, half pill), for few days as possible and not over 2 weeks

So yes, I highly recommend going 100% caffeine free. It has been much easier for me to fall asleep and also I am more awake than with caffeine. Indeed, despite caffeine temporarily reducing sleep debt (because it blocks adenosine), it makes it more difficult to sleep and also delays the circadian rhythm, so that you pay later your vigilance boost by having increased difficulties to fall asleep on subsequent nights, hence sleep less, and hence being more sleep deprived and ultimately more sleep deprived and less awake. So for the long term, definitively going 100% caffeine free is better."

The weight gain is rough (not sure if it's mostly metabolic or just the insane craving for carbs I had) and I was worried about some of the long term side effects like tardive dyskinesia and akathisia (probably unlikely on a low dose).

I have no idea what to do. Sleep on Seroquel wasn't great but sleep without any medication is very bad also (i'm on Nardil so the insomnia is likely a side effect of that). Trazodone is out. I would consider Ambien if my doc would prescribe it but I think of Z-drugs as kind of benzo-lite and don't like the idea of taking those long term, especially because I get tolerant to drugs very quickly and I'm sure I would end up having to increase the dose.

Feels like the only choice is to deal with the insomnia but getting 3 or 4 hours a night is brutal."

Sleep issues are very common and can have many underlying causes.  Most common is primary, which is usually caused by some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  Substances that don't address those underlying causes will be ineffective, probably why your herbals aren't working.

The standard of care for primary insomnia is use of a CBT sleep training system.  The basic idea is to tone down the stress about sleep and implement good sleep habits.  That can provide a permanent solution.  Much good info online about that, or your student health service will undoubtedly have resources."

*Do you find that it takes one or several hours before you can fall asleep?*

*Do you find yourself waking up several hours earlier than you should?*   
(Figuring out when, in the process of sleeping, you experience issues is important)

Another one is: Do you experience your issue(s) every night, a few times a week, a few times a month, and *how long* have you been experiencing your issue(s)?  
You said 2 months, that's long enough to go see a doctor about it (in my opinion).

And if you were diagnosed with a sleeping disorder, what would that mean to you? Are you *for* medication or against it? Are you willing to work with your doctor to fix the issue? Are you willing to change your habits?

**TL;DR** If you truly want to know, you gotta see a professional. We can't tell you. We can sympathize, that's for sure but there's no way for us to know if you have a sleeping disorder, or an underlying health issue, or some other stressor in your life that's preventing you from sleeping."

*Except airplanes*. If I'm on an airplane I sleep like a rock. Light and noise don't even matter. I think it's the G-force, it just puts me straight to sleep. No meds no nothin. Just plain regular sleep. I wake up a few times, it's not perfect sleep, but it's still the most natural sleep I'm capable of achieving."

You can look up cortisol awakening response and see how cortisol levels increase in early morning and often explains why people with generalized anxiety randomly wake up very early in the morning with extreme anxiety for no seemingly obvious reason.  

And once you start having sleep problems then that becomes its own issue to the point where even solving the anxiety disorder leaves the insomnia shadow that needs to be dealt with.  It's best to attack both in parallel."

6905,h9bmqgu,,,insomnia,1629227948,"I didn't get what I would call night terrors, but my insomnia and sleep anxiety got so bad that I would have anxiety attacks just laying down in bed.  When I did finally fall asleep I would wake up a couple hours later in what my wife would call seizures, shaking and all clenched up in my sleep.  I would then jolt awake feeling like I had just run a 400m dash.  Clearly my anxiety around sleep was so bad that my brain was literally afraid of it.  

Ultimately I used SRT (CBTi) to retrain my brain to not fear sleep so much.  I'm not 100% better but I can sleep 6hrs without anxiety attacks (though I do often awake in the morning with some slight anxiety).  I also worked very hard at managing my underlying anxiety disorder (quitting my job and having a few surgeries).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15627436/ compares the anticholinergic activity of different popular anthistamines in rats. It seems like Promethazine has pretty high activity. I personally changed to Hydroxizine after reading this study. 

I do not know if there are any other studies that contraindicates this one, or if the activity is different in humans but at least it's some kind of proof.

""In vitro, the rank order of anticholinergic potencies of the antihistamines was cyproheptadine&gt;promethazine&gt;desloratadine&gt;diphenhydramine&gt;loratadine&gt;chlorpheniramine&gt;hydroxyzine&gt;pyrilamine.""

""In vivo, five antihistamines showed anticholinergic activity: cyproheptadine&gt;promethazine&gt;desloratadine&gt;loratadine&gt;diphenhydramine. The remaining antihistamines had no significant effect at i.v. infusion doses up to 50 imol/kg."""

I have been diagnosed with ADHD a while after getting my sleep meds as well so some of my problems are probably due to that. 

Since getting this prescription I rarely have a sleepless night and mostly get 7-8 hours every night.

I want to be clear that I am in no way a doctor but I've experienced insomnia ever since I was in high school. My issues are almost always anxiety driven. I've spent a lot of time coming up with a regular sleep routine and keeping to it. I cannot stress how helpful it can be mentally and physically preparing yourself for going to sleep. Having good sleep hygiene is something that is going to be important at some point in your life so you might as well get used to it when you are young."

6957,h9aoghs,,,insomnia,1629211819,"May I ask how much you took at max? I'm currently taking 25mg as well, but it's only been a month now.

The first days I can imagine you'll notice a difference as the medicine doesn't make you tired any more, now it's all on you. There shouldn't be much more than that though, maybe some headaches and irritability. Unless you've taken more, 25mg is a very low dose. But if you still struggle with insomnia after going off, then there's tons of other medicines that are safer and less sedating. Seroquel is probably the most sedating medicine I've tried for sleep yet.

Just remember that there's no medicine that cures insomnia, just tools to help you deal with it. You should work on your routine and sleep habit while being on any medicine so that your body naturally gets tired once you go off them again. Of course that's easier said than done, but the point is to never ""give up"" on trying. Not trying to educate you if you already know this, but surprisingly many believe the medicine alone will ""cure"" them.

Good luck"

Tonight try this, eat 3-4 hrs before bed.  An hour before bed do something to wind down, dim the lights maybe read, listen to a bed time story or listen to guided meditation (highly recommend an app called Sleep Stories).  Just lay there and clear your mind and listen, distract from worry about sleep.  Do this in bed even, take your Ambien and shut off the lights.  See if anything can help reduce your anxiety over sleep.  Anxiety really just needs us to stop listening to the ‘negative voice’.

It’s not really about the strongest sleep aids, all are sedating that are prescribed.  There’s antidepressants that are sedating in low doses, z-drugs like Ambien, Lunesta, Zoplicone and theres hydroxyzine which is antihistamine.  

You need to advise your doctor of the anxiety you have and of course your sleep.  Being open and honest could result in a better choice for you rather than just saying ask for this or that.  It might be your given a separate med for the anxiety and one for sleep."

Your immune system has evidently weakened due to your lack of sleep. You only started hating your life since your insomnia? That hopefully means that self-hatred will resolve once your insomnia is treated.

First, can you tell me what things you tried? Any medication? Sleep hygiene? How much of the science of insomnia do you currently understand?

Because it's relatively simple to know what you need to address insomnia. The trick is actually executing it, especially when we all have busy lives affected by stress and things we cannot control.

If you can control your thought patterns with sleep, stay positive then I believe you can eventually make it. But remember, don't pretend to be positive. BE POSITIVE. Ask yourself if you're gonna let insomnia ruin the rest of your life. What a terrible story, what a terrible life indeed. Of course you're not gonna let that happen, so stop hating yourself for something that wasn't your fault. Instead, get up, accept your insomnia, make peace with it, find ways to treat it, and focus on other aspects of your life."

I've had chronic insomnia now for about 10 years, and I've been on at least 12 different medications to try and help with sleep.

Only thing that I found that truly puts me to sleep is 6mg of klonopin. Only problem is, I only get 15 a month, so that's really only like 2 decent nights of sleep.

Idk if you're against it (or have to drug test for work, if you're working) but maybe try Delta 8? I live in NC so weed isn't legal, but Delta 8 is almost everywhere and while it doesn't help me sleep, it definitely calms me down so I'm not so uptight from lack of sleep."

I read this yesterday evening and went to sleep with this in mind, and I've realised that often the first thing I do after my awakenings is take a deep breath, like I'm sighing - I hadn't realised it before. My heart rate is also clearly elevated right after I wake up, but I've been passing that off to the extra exercise I've been doing during the days.

You know what, ever since I was a preeten I would occasionally get these nights where I found myself waking up to a racing heart, incredible dizziness and serious shortness of breath. I've always passed these off to night terrors but now that I'm thinking about it, duh. 
I've asked around and I'm pretty sure I don't snore, although my mum said I would sometimes when I still lived with my parents. Someone I had dated had also mentioned that I breathe weird in my sleep but I didn't really think about it.

I always end up taking 6.67mg in two doses , and often take the  entire 10 mg pill in 3 doses in the night.  It’s a lifesaver.  I would not function w/out it."

Tramadol can be a long term solution but ambien? i get that for some people really nothing else works but maybe there are better options long-term?"
7104,h98hx4u,,,insomnia,1629164393,I had that for 8 nights a few years ago. Somehow on the 9th night I was magically better. Didn’t try meds besides melatonin (on the 9th night).

My favorites are: rhodiola, ashwagandha, bacopa monnieri. Best taken in the morning as they are also energizing.

In the evening, I take magnesium and lithium, which are calming -- lithium (low dose nutritional lithium) is a wonder mineral that anyone with any kind of emotional or mood issues should take (1 mg dose, from Life Extension)."
7115,h9874zu,,,insomnia,1629159412,"It started in 2018 after a knee injury (ive had other injuries but they didnt affect me as much), drs would dismiss it as it was just a minor tear in the meniscus and so did i; however the pain started to gradually increase over time, I'd limp while walking, my knee would buckle, i couldnt get out of bed or move my leg from the pain, night became unbearable as I'd be dreaming and my knee would start to hurt in the dream I'd wake up holding my knee and crying from the pain.

Ive been given opioids to help with the pain but nothing would work, i was close to oding multiple times. I couldnt sleep anymore, couldnt do anything with my life anymore.

I visited 8 different drs through a span of 9 months and they'd all tell me im faking it, except for the last one after re-examination and a final mri scan, he told me i needed surgery asap and booked it 3 days later.

I still feel a bit of pain everyday but its not as bad as it was before i can live with it, it doesnt hinder my life anymore... but ever since then I've been on multiple medications to help with my insomnia they'd work for the first couple of months and then poof back to the way it was.

(Some of my injuries include a lower back disc, multiple torn muscles, most bones have been broken, and a f'd up nerve in my right arm)"
7116,h986bqw,,,insomnia,1629159031,Works great for me...for about 4 days and then it doesn't work anymore.  Never had any weird stories or sleepwalking or whatever so I can't speak to that.  More than a day or two of usage causes me to get weird burning parasthesias.  I liked lunesta better but it still only worked for about a week before pooping out.

7122,h97t9x7,,,insomnia,1629153133,"Do you often go to bed early and lay awake for a long time? 

If so, don’t go to bed early. Stay up until 12-2:30… somewhere in there. 


The goal is to become super tired and have a big sleep drive. Might not happen the first night. After 2-4 nights it should happen and you should sleep well, even though the hours won’t be that long. 

Andrew Huberman’s recent podcast with Matt Walker discussed how 1 oz tart cherry juice and 1-2 kiwis before bed have shown amazing results in studies as a sleep aid. But more studies need to be done to confirm. I bring this up because I have been doing both the last week and have been sleeping so good. Look up the studies and read the summaries. Worth a shot.

7124,h97rr6n,,,insomnia,1629152472,What time do you wake up?
7125,h97rctk,,,insomnia,1629152299,"As an insomniac with anger issues, once I realize I'm snapping at the smallest of things or snapping at other people, I distance myself from everyone. When I know I've reached a level of anger that I can't easily come down from, all I can focus on is managing the amount of damage I do. So, I isolate myself, I distract myself with other things like TV, internet, or games and I avoid anything that could make me any angrier.

If I'm forced to interact with anyone due to circumstances beyond my control, people tend to notice and they tend to say something, so I always apologize and tell them I'm not mad at them. I tell it straight, ""I'm just mad at myself"" or ""I'm angry cause I didn't get any sleep last night"" and I try not to talk much more than that because if I start ranting I'll only work myself up even more.   


Don't underestimate how destructive you can be when you're angry. It's ok to have a sort of... healthy amount of respect for your own anger. Because you can't undue the damage you've done when you're angry. Whether the damage done was to others or yourself.  


I sort of imagine myself as a gentle giant when I'm angry. My anger makes me feel bigger than myself so I have to be extra careful and gentle when handling everything. Because I don't want to actually hurt anyone or anything. I'm just angry 🤷"

7128,h97o4q2,,,insomnia,1629150924,"Unsure from just this, but try keeping a very consistent wake time without sleeping in or napping later.  Set bedtime to allow only the min time you normally need for proper sleep.  Just doing that might help."
7129,h97nwcl,,,insomnia,1629150826,"Your parents are right about the hours you keep.  Important to keep a consistent wake time, get up and get going, and really tire yourself out for the day.  That's what helps you sleep better at night.

Set and keep that wake time very consistently and avoid sleeping in or napping later.  That practically guarantees a better night following."
7130,h97nkrl,,,insomnia,1629150691,"Best answer will come from a doc who examines you.  Key is usually how you feel upon awakening.  If you don't have much signs of sleep deprivation, that usually means you're sleeping more than you think."
7131,h97nbwb,,,insomnia,1629150589,"Generally the REM dream stage is most curtailed with sleep deprivation, as the body tends to prioritize NREM as most important.  Given that REM is associated with the brain's limbic system, which controls emotions, feeling angry or moody isn't unusual.

That doesn't mean we have to give into such feelings.  Going for consistency with mood, stability with feelings, is a good goal.  And the more you know about sleep, the easier it gets to understand where the moodiness comes from, and thereby accept it.

All the more reason to take back control, and there's many ways to do this.  Use of a CBT sleep training system will give you many tools."

At this point she removed me from any social media and I feel like I've done nothing wrong to be treated like that, I've never cheated on her and always tried to surprise her with things she would love to have. For the past months I've had similar physical problems such as higher pulse rate and palpitations, spent lots of money to endocrinology and blood tests to see what's wrong but it turned out that is just a severe anxiety..
It's painful, insomnia is killing me more but I try to fix myself and get better. Sorry for throwing my issue here but I've got no one to talk to and feel like crap. Best wishes to you."

Slept until 11 am and felt like a zombie all day. lowered my dose to 25 mg and took it at 9 and it was a bit better. I can get up at 8:30 and feel groggy for about an hour. Cut my 25mg in half (12.5) and take it at 8:30 and sleep by 10 pm and hardly any groggyness the next day. Takes a sec to find your happy medium, hope the 12.5 works for you as it did for me. 

It’s so crazy to be able to sleep now, I’m envious of my husband that he has been able to fall asleep this quickly without a drug lol. Only con for me is no late night sex cause I’m actually out vs before I was up all night ;)"

Best of luck to us all"
7148,h979klq,,,insomnia,1629145105,"I haven’t cured it. I still have issues getting to sleep, I still wake up throughout the night. But, I do sleep a whole lot better than I did for the last month and a half or so. 

For me, I’m predisposed to anxiety through genetics. However, my wife leaving me out of nowhere was the kicker that started a whole bunch of issues for me - racing heart, blood pressure through the roof, and panic. So now, any time something happens, I try to gain control over it, and that proves to be an issue.

In this case, I had a night or two in a hotel where I told myself I was going to sleep well and to do so I was going to bed at 8; turns out I had zero sleep drive at 8 and because I did that I stayed up all night. As soon as my body realized I could do that, I’ve been afraid of it, which has driven a cycle of it, which has led to me trying to solve it. But trying to solve it is actually hyperfixation on it that’s driving it.

So what does my doctor do? Puts me on Lunesta (which is basically Diet Ativan). It works, I get addicted, and now I really can’t sleep without it. 

So, after enough of that, I tapered myself off it, stopped caring, started distracting myself more, take ten mg of melatonin a night and now I can sleep. You gotta stop caring."

Unless you have a severe deficiency, this is some insane anxiety and you’ve gotta find a way to distract yourself otherwise your mind will spin until you’re mentally and physically sick. Podcasts are how I do it, it may a little different for you. But you got this. Experiment around until you find the thing that works for you. Also, cardio."

After starting sleep restriction i was asleep with 30 min of going to bed and slept through the night. This started the second night. I don’t think it usually works this easier for lost people. I was lucky  

The biggest difference is how tired i am now at bedtime. I am pretty tired by the time i go to sleep now."
7159,h9716xl,,,insomnia,1629141807,"Ambien is amazing for helping sleep onset insomnia.  It gives me what I call ‘black out’ sleep.  It’s a different kind of sleep for me, i think it inhibits REM sleep, I can’t take it every night.  

Take on empty stomach (think 3 hours after eating); Do not redose in the night, example if you bypass the hypnotic effect as in you stay awake through the ‘knock you out’ effect which is usually ~20 mins you may find your self awake on it and want to take more.  

Of course every ones biological makeup is different how we metabolize meds and their true effectiveness.  I’ve experienced less effectiveness (tolerance) with nightly use, plus as I mentioned the refreshed sleep isn’t something I get on it.  

I’ve seen reports here in this sub some want to (or do add) with other drugs, cross tolerance can happen especially if you add on similar meds that act on the the same receptors. Always seek guidance of your doctor, we are of course our own anecdotal experts."
7160,h970htw,,,insomnia,1629141525,"I was taking 40mg of propranolol as initial dose and it would actually cause insomnia so I reduce it 20mg, then 10mg and didn't have any sleep problems then. Everytime before sleep I was watching some YouTube and would actually help me but now it has gotten more tough to fall asleep even doing my casual night routine: just staying in bed on my laptop or phone until I feel like I need to sleep and that was it. I won't blame my anxiety for this because I had it months ago with panic attacks before insomnia would hit so I was sleeping well. My fear of not getting enough sleep until it would damage my brain is keeping me awake and don't feel like I need sleep at all. I've been reading lot of stuff about people getting daily doses of medication to actually get some rest and I don't want to rely on medication to be able to sleep, this would be one of my nightmares.

So anyways, I noticed the first week not taking it my anxiety was terrible. Worse than ever before. Because those pills help in the moment but it doesn’t cure anything. 
So for a month straight I thought I was cured just to find out that I was masking everything behind a pill. 

Even my dr said the only true way to help yourself is to figure out why youre anxious and nip it. It sounds waaaay easier said than done but I’m telling you it’s so worth it."

I couldn’t sleep that night. Uncomfortable as hell sleeping in the back of a Ford Taurus. “No big deal,” I thought. “I’ll just rest my eyes and then I’ll sleep when I get home in the morning.”

Couldn’t sleep that morning.

Couldn’t sleep that night.

Couldn’t sleep that week.

Can’t sleep 15 years later, happily married to another woman and able to more maturely handle relationship bumps.

Weird shit."

7173,h96vqhi,,,insomnia,1629139609,"I think I m a good candidate for this question. 

Had 6 months of music lyrics repetion in my head but could sleep without issue. I have slight Ocd but it got really bad with these songs in my head. 

Started taking xanax because it was getting worse at night. Have fallen asleep in 5 minutes. On the day I discontinued xanax I could not fall asleep anymore took me 3 hours to fall asleep. Never ever  in my 30 years have I experienced that before. It was suddenly. 

From then I have sleep issues.  If i take ambien i fall asleep in 5 minutes. 

Not sure if xanax caused it or would my brain blow up anyways because of these lyrics and repetitve environment in my head."

7175,h96uvdw,,,insomnia,1629139265,"I just went through this, it’s a bit of a manic state. So a few things we need to do here: propranolol is a beta blocker (Im on them too) which is going to reduce the amount of melatonin you’re producing. So go grab about ten milligrams of instant release melatonin and take that as you’re falling asleep. Second thing, do not stop eating or withdraw from your social life; keep it going; otherwise you’ll enter an agoraphobic state of isolation and self feeding panic.

Next, whereas a normal person would want to quit all the screens before bed, you need to distract your mind from your ruminations. So crank that bad boy into night mode and start playing Bubble Witch/Candy Crush/MegaBattleFarmGeneric Game until you start feeling sleepy, which you will. 

And finally as you’re falling asleep, put on a podcast just loud enough you can hear the words but not distractingly loud. And listen to it. Listen and focus in on the words. Doing this will prevent your mind from keeping you awake by focusing on sleep."

it was complex sleep apnea (obstructive and central apnea).

I had some success with it, but I did it a little differently.  I would drank a decent amount of water before I lied down at night (130am ish) and I would wake up at 430am ish and pee and I would fall right back asleep deeply and sleep around 4-5 hours.

To put it in context. I would fall asleep at 130am and have an alarm set for 930am. I kept waking up at 630am to 730am everyday and wasn't able to sleep more and felt groggy and slightly off all day. I found intentionally breaking up my sleep got me 7+ hours where attempting to sleep 7+ hours traight hours almost never worked.

Probably worth bringing up with your dr or seeing if next time you can taper it and not have a response.

when you are in deep sleep neurons hypersynchronize and on eeg you have big waves. Bz and ambien inhibits neurons, reduce this hypersynchornization and inhibits deep stage sleep.

Bz and Z-compounds helps only in severe insomnia. Sleep for 4 hours is better than sleep 8h with Bz (tested on myself). And they have side effect:

\- short term side effect: such as **anterograde amesia** (you should not take them the night before an exam), grogginess,  difficulty in thinking, drowsiness, Lack of coordination and decreased alertness and concentration. YOU SHOULD NOT DRIVE THE MORNING AFTER TAKING IT.

If take 10 1mg pills just for relief and it never helped.

Had to go to tge ER Friday night for some crazy ass health issues, and they gave me a couple days worth of Valium. Thankfully the Valium is kind of like klonopin, as in it actually works. Ativan is the only benzo I've ever taken that did not do a single thing for me. Might as well have been a sugar pill.

7239,h94zxco,,,insomnia,1629107745,"I've managed by making small adjustments based on how I feel in the morning. If I have slept only 3 or 4 hours, I assess first if I can drive (usually not) and so I tell work I might be a bit later as I have to get the bus.

Then I make a point of having little things to look forward to during the day, like a nice hot chocolate in 2 hours time and later I will have a nice dinner. If I had plans like socialising I'll adapt those too, like invite a friend round instead of going out. This way you are still in control of your life and learning very important skills too while you go through this challenge. 

I've started CBTi which I highly recommend if you've not looked into it. It's apparently the gold standard treatment for insomnia that none of my doctors told me about. I found that the site Sleepio is free at the moment in the UK and it's working so far in the sense that I fall asleep really fast and can go back to sleep after waking. I'm still on small hours of sleep so far but hopeful as there's lots of evidence that this treatment works.

7245,h94ub5n,,,insomnia,1629102990,"Sleep debt is a thing : 

""Let's do some sleep math. You lost two hours of sleep every night last week because of a big project due on Friday. On Saturday and Sunday, you slept in, getting four extra hours. Come Monday morning, you were feeling so bright-eyed, you only had one cup of coffee, instead of your usual two. But don't be duped by your apparent vim and vigor: You're still carrying around a heavy load of sleepiness, or what experts call ""sleep debt""—in this case something like six hours, almost a full nights' sleep.

Sleep debt is the difference between the amount of sleep you should be getting and the amount you actually get. It's a deficit that grows every time we skim some extra minutes off our nightly slumber. ""People accumulate sleep debt surreptitiously,"" says psychiatrist William C. Dement, founder of the Stanford University Sleep Clinic. Studies show that such short-term sleep deprivation leads to a foggy brain, worsened vision, impaired driving, and trouble remembering. Long-term effects include obesity, insulin resistance, and heart disease. And most Americans suffer from chronic deprivation.
 
A 2005 survey by the National Sleep Foundation reports that, on average, Americans sleep 6.9 hours per night—6.8 hours during the week and 7.4 hours on the weekends. Generally, experts recommend eight hours of sleep per night, although some people may require only six hours of sleep while others need ten. That means on average, we’re losing one hour of sleep each night—more than two full weeks of slumber every year.

The good news is that, like all debt, with some work, sleep debt can be repaid—though it won't happen in one extended snooze marathon. Tacking on an extra hour or two of sleep a night is the way to catch up. For the chronically sleep deprived, take it easy for a few months to get back into a natural sleep pattern, says Lawrence J. Epstein, medical director of the Harvard-affiliated Sleep HealthCenters.

Go to bed when you are tired, and allow your body to wake you in the morning (no alarm clock allowed). You may find yourself catatonic in the beginning of the recovery cycle: Expect to bank upward of ten hours shut-eye per night. As the days pass, however, the amount of time sleeping will gradually decrease.

For recovery sleep, both the hours slept and the intensity of the sleep are important. Some of your most refreshing sleep occurs during deep sleep. Although such sleep's true effects are still being studied, it is generally considered a restorative period for the brain. And when you sleep more hours, you allow your brain to spend more time in this rejuvenating period.

As you erase sleep debt, your body will come to rest at a sleep pattern that is specifically right for you. Sleep researchers believe that genes—although the precise ones have yet to be discovered—determine our individual sleeping patterns. That more than likely means you can't train yourself to be a ""short sleeper""—and you're fooling yourself if you think you've done it. A 2003 study in the journal Sleep found that the more tired we get, the less tired we feel.

So earn back that lost sleep—and follow the dictates of your innate sleep needs. You’ll feel better. ""When you put away sleep debt, you become superhuman,"" says Stanford's Dement, talking about the improved mental and physical capabilities that come with being well rested. Finally, a scientific reason to sleep in on Saturday."""

Imo eventually the sleep deprivation might lead you back to anxiety or depression. For me it's difficult not to feel anxious when I'm sleep deprived. 
Trying another medication right now while you are not working might be a good idea. 
Doing therapy and your own deep work can be also a good idea while you're on this medication, since you feel better, you can make some progress and maybe that can help you can get off or switch to another medication easier (although not sure if sleep deprivation would prevent you from doing things like therapy and deep self work. I sure don't think I could with that with so little sleep)"

You don't say you're not addicted to caffeine because it servers a purpose. Anyways, I am no doctor but, are you sure medications like benzodiazepines or ambien would be better than weed?

7272,h947w5j,,,insomnia,1629086723,"Mirtazapine is an antidepressant prescribed off label for insomnia at low doses eg 7.5mg.  As an antidepressant it may take 4-6 weeks for the drug to reach optimal levels in your system to treat anxiety or depression.  As a sleep aid the H1 antihistamine is supposed sedating and immediate.  The sedating effects are from two mechanisms of action one the H1 antihistamine, the other the 5HT2C antagonism.  At higher doses the drug changes properties from more serotonergic to noradrenergic and the sedation diminishes.  This drug affects many neurotransmitters in the brain and has withdrawal ramifications just after 3 weeks of use. 
Trazodone is another antidepressant prescribed off label for insomnia at lower doses 25-50-100mg.  Again, sedation primarily from another H1 antihistamine and 5HT2A antagonist.  Also affects many neurotransmitters in the brain.  The sedating effects should be immediate.  
It should be noted that sleep aids and antidepressants disrupt REM sleep and deep sleep needed for brain and muscle recovery."

I used to take Ambien CR 12.5 mg plus 1-1.5mg Xanax at night to go to bed…. Started like you just .25mg Xanax and I had to slowly keep upping the dose to chase my sleep.

I don’t take Xanax anymore luckily I weaned myself off of it but it was rough!  

I still take ambien like 7.5mg a night and 25mg seroquel which has worked for me for years now.

Just be careful!"
7279,h9408sd,,,insomnia,1629082558,"would 1 mg xanax be okay too ? it makes me really tired too and maybe the ambien would last all night then, because i took ambien alone last night and it did absolutely nothing i was up all night with anxiety"

My advice: There is no easy option. Treat the insomnia and whatever is causing it first. You cannot manage insomnia and heavy responsibilities at the same time. This will require some serious planning and reorganization of your time. Hobbies, screen time, and any other 'non-essentials' will have to go (temporarily) so that you can see a doctor and use the freed up time to rebuild your sleep routine. Meds are only half the battle.

There is no use hiding it from your boss. You have to be upfront about it and find the time to discuss it in a professional setting. Hopefully something can be worked out. I am so thankful that my boss understood and we worked out a plan. Had to take a pay cut but I agreed it was fair.

Driving was absolutely off-limits on bad nights (which was most). Arrange a car pool or use public transit. If you can afford Ubers than do it (Plan your finances accordingly. You will find that insomnia is expensive). 

I had to learn the hard way that you are going to make your insomnia worse if you delve on the negatives. Try as much as possible to think positively (as difficult as it may seem) and be grateful for what you currently have. Slowly as you improve you can steadily reintroduce hobbies and activities back into your life. At 23 you still have so much ahead of you. Do what needs to be done first. I'm rooting for you."
7281,h93zbl5,,,insomnia,1629082094,And by what do you mean it doesn’t work the way I think it does because I’ve shown quite a few of the symptoms. Started out with 1-2 hours of sleep now I hardly get any sleep. Ever.

7285,h93xveq,,,insomnia,1629081362,"It's likely ok, as long as you haven't drunk alcohol or taken other medication.

Don't make a habit of either drug, the rebound effects are worse than the original problem. You have to learn to self-soothe and set up sleep-triggering routines, for example - a sandwich and glass of milk waiting at your bedside every night, in a clean room with a made bed, to be enjoyed after a hot shower, then stretching/relaxing exercises, then sleep.

I don't mean to trivialise the degree of your problem, but speaking as an older person with life-long sleep difficulties, the meds can only help so far, in extreme times, they are not the solution. You have to craft a routine and a solution to suit you. Sleep hygiene, and established habits and sleep triggers are the only long-term solution."

It’s the only medication that has ever helped my depression and anxiety (I’ve tried over a dozen of them) so I really don’t want to stop taking it. As I mentioned in my post, I have tried so many sleep meds in an attempt to fix the insomnia but most have not helped. Consequently, it looks like the insomnia is going to be a long term issue for me. And so, I posted this to get insight into how I can manage this sleep deprivation once I start working a full-time job, which will be next January. Specifically, how can I increase the likelihood that I adequately perform my job duties when I’m so mentally out of it due to the sleep issue? 

Someone else who commented accused me of just using this as an excuse to leech off my dad but nope, not the case at all. It would be fun to live with my dad forever but don’t think he’d like that. 🥲"

7348,h928n0m,,,insomnia,1629053079,"I know people who have a coffee before bed and still sleep. I have one in the morning, can't sleep. My doctor seems to think anything in the morning is enough time to be ok. I've honestly tried nothing electronic in the evening and I still can't sleep. I just leave the tv on now as a distraction from worrying why I'm still awake!"
7349,h9282xu,,,insomnia,1629052838,"A puff or two of cannabis right before bed is helpful, more especially if you haven’t smoked at all during the day. Use CBD as well in this case. If it’s already in your system, it won’t do much for you. Two tablets of Benadryl and some soothing music or white noise help also. Avoid alcohol."
7350,h9266pk,,,insomnia,1629052027,Actually when I drink coffee sometimes I sleep better. Before getting insomnia I was drinking a lot of caffeine 4 hours before bed and slept like a baby.

7352,h925liy,,,insomnia,1629051775,Yep
7353,h923rzt,,,insomnia,1629050996,same. I have months where I am training hard and things seem well but I always know in the back of my mind that its temporary.
7354,h923bnc,,,insomnia,1629050802,its the domino effect. one thing goes bad and its all in shit in no time.
7355,h92389x,,,insomnia,1629050762,"This has happened to me several times.

Told a doctor that I had a single cup of decaf in the early morning and he immediately blamed my insomnia on that without a single care for the fact that besides that I was being extra careful in every aspect related to sleep hygiene.

There's also the doctor that told me I had depression because when he asked me if something was bothering me, I told him that sometimes I would get stressed out with grad work (completely normal and my insomnia only appeared 4 years into uni), therefore he concluded that my insomnia was caused by depression that was caused by my studies. I consulted a psychiatrist after and turns out I don't have depression (duh!).

It's honestly scary how short-sighted some doctors are."
7356,h922lxm,,,insomnia,1629050497,"what happened after the 5 days? i was not able to take it anymore, my brain chemistry was very weird at the time, no doctor was able to help nor knew what was going on with. Lots of the standard drugs had either no or only negative side effects. 

A dose of 10 mg amphetamines then calmed me down enough that i was finally able to sleep for a few hours.

You can go with little sleep like 10-20 hours per week for months without dying. it is not healthy and increases your risks for all kinds of things."
7357,h921zi8,,,insomnia,1629050230,"The sleep deprivation will certainly will make it much worse. if your anxiety is spiraling out of control like this, you should see a psychiatrist as soon as possible and tell him about your escalating sleep deprivation, panic and anxiety. 

if you get dependent on xanax now but can't get a new script, you will have some serious issues. 0.5 mg of Xanax every 4 hours = 10 mg every 4 hours * 6 = 60 mg Diazepam.

That would already be a lot. if you take this dose for 2 weeks, you will have nasty withdrawal lasting for a minimum of 2-4 weeks with much worse anxiety and insomnia.

So you do need some kind of plan that either involves a doctor or not taking xanax, the latter seems impossible in your situation. 

Like you would expect that a daily dose of 1,5 mg Xanax is enough in your situation but your panic is just spiraling out of control?"

I don’t know the exact cost but was told it was only possible for the extremely wealthy. I really wanted to try it and was very disappointed that I couldn’t."

7386,h91cvlf,,,insomnia,1629039677,"Debunking. 

For instance, Walker has claimed that shorter sleep leads to shorter life span, which is wrong. 

I find it discouraging that this guy has become so popular and keeps churning out invalid claims."
7387,h91cmu7,,,insomnia,1629039567,"Okay, i would advise to not take xanax for more than 3-4 days. The longer you take it, the worse the rebound anxiety will be.

xanax also has such a short half-life, to cover a full day, you would need to take 0.25 mg x 3. No surprise you still have so many symptoms. 

if i were you, i would seek access to long acting Benzodiazepine: Clonazepam (Klonopin) seems more appropriate in your situation and is easier to stop. 

Most likely your symptoms will go away by themselves if you just give it time. i have been without sleep for up to 5 days."
7388,h91cjij,,,insomnia,1629039526,"That's a pretty sweet deal. Clearly its not common but there are a % of people who just straight up need less sleep.
but If you still feel sleep deprived but you are energetic I also would attribute that to some compensatory adrenaline. 

It happens to me once in a while when I have somehow had some reasonable sleep for a couple days, if I sleep less on the next day I get a boost in productivity, but it almost feels like autopilot more than when I am actually rested. But it is so strange that I feel somewhat motivated to check some things off my to do list on those days! 

I have adhd and I have a theory that maybe metacognitive areas of my brain are tuckered out and so I less mental blocks in task initiation than usual somehow? Or possibly described as  I'm more impulsive so its not always super logical but I'm like ""ah ok im gonna start that email draft""  

a year ago or so I posted in an adhd group asking if anyone else experienced this and a couple people said ""yes actually now that you mention it!"" so theres that too :) 

So yeah haha thats my experience personally and also sourcing from my bio psych degree (just undergrad but enough to theorize probable causes)"
7389,h91brxz,,,insomnia,1629039183,It worked great for me as well but now I don’t take anything and I’m doing ok. Not amazing but ok. It’s just not worth the insomnia. I feel like insomnia is a way more rapid decline in my mental health trying to work and take care of children.
7390,h91bc68,,,insomnia,1629038987,"Are your summary lines there what Walker is claiming or debunking what Walker is claiming? For example did Walker claim that shorter sleep implies a shorter life span or did he claim that No, shorter sleep does not imply a shorter life span."

Im not normally an insomniac or have anxiety like this, I only take 100mg of Zoloft for depression."
7398,h91a8yh,,,insomnia,1629038496,Interesting! I 'accidentally' do this like once a month. I'll think about it. 10 hrs is usually enough?

7400,h919r7a,,,insomnia,1629038270,"How long has it been since you have covid? Do you have any other weird symptoms? Fatigue? Headache? You must be feeling like a disaster! 

if you continue taking xanax .25 mg for another week, you certainly will develop some kind of dependence. 0.25 mg of xanax already equals 5 mg of Diazepam.

Think carefully if you want to continue taking the xanax and what you would do if you doctor cuts you off / you can't get a new script. The ambien not having any effect already could be due tolerance from xanax. 

And just for my timeline: you developed those symptoms described above and afterwards you started taking xanax?"

7448,h90hmqy,,,insomnia,1629019861,Set alarms. Don't let yourself sleep that long. Be tired and go to bed early. I hope....about to try it.
7449,h90hkpa,,,insomnia,1629019810,Shouldn’t this help if anything
7450,h90hcwl,,,insomnia,1629019613,"For sure. I go on 1 to 3 day binges...right now is 25 hours in...and I am out of the bed on reddit....I will go read in bed though once the drugs kick in. If I don't sleep, at least I'll gets some reading in...

  


But...gtfo of bed for a while. Don't just lay there in thought. Once you calm down THEN try reading in bed...or on the couch."
7451,h90hbq1,,,insomnia,1629019584,that's my problem: I'm just too tired to actually get out of bed...
7452,h90h6se,,,insomnia,1629019457,This is awesome!
7453,h90h4cf,,,insomnia,1629019395,Does that mean that you go to bed at 2:45 now instead of the time you were going to bed before?
7454,h90h457,,,insomnia,1629019389,"Do you have someone in your life who does support you? A family member? A doctor you can really trust?

if you could freely choose the time when you sleep without any restrictions, could you then find a time where you can sleep or is there no hope?

How many hours are you actually sleeping per week?

Sleep disorder have reasons and obviously in your case all kinds of trauma plays a big role. That needs to be addressed long-term.

Also taking meds and becoming an addict: it would really depend on what kind of drugs you are taking. Benzodiazepines and similar drugs are almost never a long-term solution for sleeping problems anyway.

What meds have you tried in the past?"
7455,h90gxgb,,,insomnia,1629019219,"Just read up on it..been awake for 25 hours. ACT might work for you, not for me.

  


I just chugged some niquil and sleepy tea. Gonna read a book next to my snoring wife and try not to concentrate on anything but the book...and nudging her for snoring so darn loud."
7456,h90gwnv,,,insomnia,1629019200,"You can try Tryptophan as alternative for Melatonin. For some people who get some benefit out of melatonin but don't tolerate it because of side effects, it is the solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that: could be some kind of circadian disorder, maybe irregular type or DSPD and you are so massively sleep deprived, that you then sleep so many hours. Not every human has a clean 24h day / night rhythm or can entrain to one."

r/DSPD

or could even somethin else. try to track your sleep for a couple weeks &amp; try to naturally wake up instead of alarm. depending on your age it could be numerous things really, but DSPD sounds close to your issue or at least a transient delayed sleep"
7458,h90c8r3,,,insomnia,1629015004,"Well, at least now you know that you don't tolerate Mirtazapine and most likely drugs from the same class. 

Small dose Quetiapine could be worth a shot or occasional Ambien / Benzodiazepines."
7459,h90bt4e,,,insomnia,1629014633,"Mirtazapine, I don't think it's good for people, but what do I know"
7460,h90bjit,,,insomnia,1629014415,"Pills can be a solution for some but it would depend on the reason of the insomnia behind it. 

What exactly did your doctor prescribe? Most likely it will just be a few days to whatever it was before."
7461,h90b9w3,,,insomnia,1629014190,Something similar happened to me: was in the best form of my life only to develop two acute neurological disorders at the same time. 10 years later i haven't fully recovered and never will. My sleep will always be f\*cked and honestly always was. s
7462,h90b9cw,,,insomnia,1629014179,"Ambien doesn't work for me which puzzles my doc 😁Started Trazodone a couple of days back, first week it did nothing for me, but last two days it definitely got better. I don't fall asleep immediately but maybe in 1,5hours  but it still is great not having to stare at walls for 4 hours. Started with 50mg, upped to 100 but it made me very dizzy and ""hungover"" in the morning so now I take 75mg. The only side effect is stuffy nose and little dizziness in the morning."
7463,h90b543,,,insomnia,1629014083,"Well, you could try and withdraw, stop it, you will feel like disaster for a bit and maybe after 4 weeks or more your sleep will start to normalize.

You could also slowly reduce your dose. if you start taking trazodone, you risk getting dependent on it like weed. 

if you can afford it, just stop, eat healthy and see what happens but when you have to study or work, that could be an issue."
7464,h90b3ij,,,insomnia,1629014047,"Also last night(it’s 4 am here, so the night is over) I slept for 6 or 7 hours and dreamed. I felt amazing the next morning but still a bit drowsy"
7465,h90b2bv,,,insomnia,1629014021,"I have support, and I can sleep better than this sometimes, but insomnia is always there lurking. The doctor gave me antidepressants recently,  I only took them for three days before saying fuck this( they made me feel so much worse, emotionless) and after that my Insomnia has been so much worse. That's why I don't recommend people taking the shit doctors prescribe, but each to their own."
7466,h90b1ta,,,insomnia,1629014009,"Nearly 4 am here, didn't sleep much last night, dreading going to bed and lying awake... so yeah. I get you. I wish I could *help,* but all I can offer is ""Yup. That sucks."""
7467,h90avft,,,insomnia,1629013868,"Thank you! :) I wish there was a way to just know 100% that I don’t have it. This disease is so horrible—I don’t even know why it exists!

7468,h90arap,,,insomnia,1629013776,"Do you have someone in your life who can support you? 

Can you at least sleep during other times when you are not forced to keep to a schedule?"
7469,h90alon,,,insomnia,1629013649,im currently on 48 hour cycles and that has pretty much cured my insomnia.
7470,h90a5gy,,,insomnia,1629013278,Bro I’m going through this rn don’t worry sfi is super rare and basically never occurs it’s just normal insomnia you’ll be fine my guy
7471,h9061z3,,,insomnia,1629009987,I totally get it! That’s what’s happening to me. But what frustraste me is that I did not need weed before
7472,h905mo3,,,insomnia,1629009654,"I guess you asked for help tho, for me it really helps if I get up for some water or something. Maybe even just going outside and taking a few deep breaths and just chilling out. I think I get mad when I can’t sleep and it keeps me up, so just kinda chill out and it’ll happen eventually"
7473,h905gol,,,insomnia,1629009530,"Weed has really messed with my sleep. It’s just a good way to fall asleep, it always works, and makes me refreshed the next day. If I can’t smoke I’ll take an edible, but then I’m hooked on all this damn weed and I need to take a break. So I drink a few beers. Then I’m drinking too much. I try to go sober and I can’t sleep at all. My mind just keeps racing and it feels like more effort to shut my eyes than keep them open. When I smoke or drink it just lets me drift off until I wake up. Idk this shits really pissing me off rn and I’m just ranting but it’s frustrating as hell"
7474,h904zuo,,,insomnia,1629009172,"In psychology I learned about sleep waves and stuff. Basically when you sleep you rotate through all these stages and they loop, and waking up in some is better than others. I heard that like anything after a 45 minute nap will make you feel groggy, but if you sleep for like 2 hours or something when it loops back around it’s better, I have no idea on specifics. Anyway that’s always been my explanation for that, also probably a pride thing, just to say I had no sleep last night and I’m doing all this stuff"
7475,h904bwm,,,insomnia,1629008663,I’ve been offered zopiclone and mirtrazapine but have yet to get them on perscription
7476,h9047kb,,,insomnia,1629008571,Cause worrying alot about exams and project since then i never slept deeply

My timeline is all messed up and I’m not sure whether I started antidepressants before or after that, but it may have been the antidepressants that kicked off my
Insomnia. Then later on I got off a medication cold turkey and just stopped sleeping all together for 3 days at a time. I really feel like meds played a large roll in my current struggle with insomnia"
7479,h8zydx6,,,insomnia,1629004388,have you tried melatonin?
7480,h8zy95p,,,insomnia,1629004301,Good luck!
7481,h8zy17z,,,insomnia,1629004154,it started in 7th grade. Starting from when i got home from school i wasnt allowed to relax at all. This caused a buttload of stress on me and I couldnt sleep.
7482,h8zvzif,,,insomnia,1629002825,"It's ok, man. I **promise** you're not alone. You may feel defeated but feelings don't last forever. You should treat yourself to something nice on the tougher nights. (I treat myself to some popcorn on the real bad nights lol)  


🤞Fingers crossed you get a second wind to help you through the day. Best of luck to you, man."
7483,h8zvpjh,,,insomnia,1629002648,I think for those of us who have it bad I think it’s a challenge. We may not get it under control fully but we can get to a better sleep schedule. I think sleep is complicated for those with multiple issues affecting good sleep. Because to get good sleep you need good habits both mentally and physically. And any health or mental problems that prevent good sleep have to be addressed.

7489,h8zs0ph,,,insomnia,1629000388,"It helped me temporarily.  The problem was that I developed some tolerance to it after a week and had to up the dosage. Still, it is helpful if used temporarily and in conjunction with talk therapy and other medical treatments."

7502,h8zmrqr,,,insomnia,1628997389,Weed actually keeps me awake :( isnt that weird
7503,h8zl6fh,,,insomnia,1628996511,Weed. Life long anxiety and intrusive thoughts sufferer and weed is the only thing that has ever helped. It shows down my mind and relaxes my body  enough to fall and stay asleep. I also wake up super refreshed compared to any meds iv ever taken. Valium ect leaves me groggy for days.
7504,h8zkt4y,,,insomnia,1628996314,"If 5 mg allows you to sleep, that certainly would be beneficial over taking 10 mg. 

In any case: look for a therapist. People like you can easily develop a psychological addiction towards sleeping pills. So be careful and if you need 10 mg to sleep, then you need 10 mg.

But what happens when you are out of pills? Also sleep from sleeping pills is not the same ad natural sleep."
7505,h8ziowz,,,insomnia,1628995196,It’s all thanks to autism
7506,h8zi22i,,,insomnia,1628994859,"Lol. I especially love where it comes from medical professionals. “Your medical history says you’ve been suffering from intermittent chronic insomnia for 10 years. Perhaps you should Google ‘sleep hygiene’.”

7508,h8zh3ox,,,insomnia,1628994356,I feel you. My mum didnt care and would punish me for not sleeping even when I just couldnt help it. Infact it made my insomnia worse. Now she wonders why i never text/ call her

7514,h8zdr7o,,,insomnia,1628992610,"i see , if xanax doesnt make me sleepy , will ambien work to put me to sleep ? im not planning on long term use of either i wanna be responsible with it"
7515,h8zdmgu,,,insomnia,1628992543,"I never felt panicked, but all night my mind would race. It used to only happen before a work day, when i had to wake up early. I get it though. My anxious thoughts come to me in the shower and i have to groan or curse myself constantly. Its so miserable. Now before bed, i take 100mg of trazodone, and smoke weed when i get in bed. Then I let the tv play until I’m too tired to listen to it."
7516,h8zdifv,,,insomnia,1628992486,They are absolutely just as addictive. The dosage is what’s important when determining such risks. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2000636/
7517,h8zd5rf,,,insomnia,1628992306,Do not listen to this person. Ambien is absolutely addictive and the withdrawal can cause fatal seizures just like benzo withdrawal because they work on the same receptor.
7518,h8zd06p,,,insomnia,1628992228,Yeah it’s in a similar class to xanax which is an anxiolytic. Actually some doctors give ambien for pre-surgical anxiety
7519,h8zcjxz,,,insomnia,1628991998,"I totally know what you mean. When my panic attacks started, it would happen when I’d be trying to sleep. Racing heart, tightness in the chest, racing thoughts, chest pain, and a weird feeling down my left arm. Ended up going to the ER several times, thinking I was having a heart attack. Ambien has been good for getting me to sleep, even when I’m in panic attack mode. I’m not crazy about being knocked out every night, but it works!"

7524,h8z3t73,,,insomnia,1628987589,"I mentioned to my mum’s sister, how I was struggling with insomnia and sleep paralysis, and she had the nerve to say, while laughing at me, “Why can’t you just get over it?” I have been ignoring her ever since."

Last year I was up for 4 days straight and started having audio/visual hallucinations. Went to the ER and they gave me a shot of Ativan. Only put me yo sleep for about two hours, but I felt a shit ton better after those 2 hours."
7527,h8z2yp9,,,insomnia,1628987155,Get the fuck out of bed if you can't sleep. I know associate my bed with insomnia and I can hardly ever sleep in my bed now.

7529,h8z2gi0,,,insomnia,1628986894,This drug saved my sanity and was the only thing that knocks me to sleep! I've tried everything you described and I thank whoevers up there every night for this drug lol. You'll sleep well

7533,h8z25aw,,,insomnia,1628986735,"100%, I was 5 days zero sleep - I needed it as well.  Hopefully you will sleep tonight, and tomorrow I highly recommend trying to go to bed without it.  You will have it as a crutch, but do your best not to have to take it.

Another recommendation, get out of bed at 6:30Am tomorrow no matter what time you fall asleep.  Force yourself out of bed, and go stand in the window our go outside.  Look at the sunrise.  It sounds weird but it will help reboot your brain into a normal sleep cycles."

7544,h8yt5mx,,,insomnia,1628982198,"If the dreams are from a specific source (job stress for example) writing about it before bed can get it out of your brain a bit.  One theory of dreams is they give us a way to deal with unresolved issues of the day… 

Then do something quiet but unrelated to the stressor immediately leading to sleep - reading is great bc it can give your brain a whole other source of dream material.   Music is another option.  

Finally if it goes on much longer see your doc about a very short course of anti anxiety medication to break the cycle…"
7545,h8yrdgx,,,insomnia,1628981327,I know how much the searching sucks. I feel like I straight didn’t sleep for the first six years of my 20s.

The main things that help the most are an ssri (which she doesn't know about) and melatonin.

7549,h8ynbgc,,,insomnia,1628979344,Take it when you are already in bed ready for sleep. It hits pretty hard.

I take a combo of 25mg seroquel and like 3/4 ambien and that works for me and doesn’t make me all spaced out next day.

I wouldn’t go with anything benzo tho that stuff gives you horrible withdrawals."
7552,h8yhxid,,,insomnia,1628976778,"Well you took some lightweight medication for insomnia. If that doesn't work you could try things like, zolpidem, benzos, mirtrazapine..."
7553,h8yhova,,,insomnia,1628976668,"They are very similar to benzos but a weaker. Xanax is more powerful (this is what my psychiatrists said in London).   
They were specifically designed to address sleep issues. They should not be use in continuity. You take them when you really need them. They are usually taken to break the insomnia cycle.  
Of-course some people take them every day for years. Don't fall into that trap.  
It's not good, and you'll have some hard time going off of them.

The best sleep is the natural sleep believe me, I tried ambien, xanax, mirtrazapine and they all worked perfectly but should not be used indefinitely.  


Once you adapt to your insomnia you'll stop caring about it and then it should gradually go away. People live with that for years, it can be debilitating depending on the severity but it's not life threatening at all."
7554,h8ygec6,,,insomnia,1628976072,Glad you found your med!  I am still searching.
7555,h8ygaa9,,,insomnia,1628976022,Not really reassuring.  Said it will help take the edge off so I can fall asleep.  I need to be knocked out.  Took an Ativan earlier to test it out.  Did nothing.  Now I’m screwed.

7557,h8yfvj8,,,insomnia,1628975839,You start with what your doctor prescribed.
7558,h8yfuin,,,insomnia,1628975826,okay i will thank you :)
7559,h8yfr9r,,,insomnia,1628975785,Stop second guessing your doctor. Take your medicine as prescribed and get some sleep.
7560,h8yfdk2,,,insomnia,1628975611,"also, should i start with 5 mg or go straight for the 10 ? they are different from a benzo, right ? because xanax doesnt make me sleepy"
7561,h8yfav9,,,insomnia,1628975578,Do you personally know him? He just told you his body and mind have withered away because of insomnia. How dare you minimize what he is sharing with others by making such an arrogant and ignorant statement about his health and trouble with sleep.
7562,h8yf71r,,,insomnia,1628975529,Hahaha yesss !!!! I cant wait. I hope I dont do anything crazy on it ....
7563,h8yf3jz,,,insomnia,1628975485,ahhh perfect thats exactly what i need ! are they safe to take alongside xanax ?
7564,h8ydw0y,,,insomnia,1628974927,"I see a lot of ruined lives due to insomnia. My intent is to educate people regarding the health consequences of insomnia so they will be motivated to take real action to manage their insomnia. 

There are many ways to try to manage insomnia. What works for one will not necessarily work for others. Many people find that prescription sleep medications have helped them immensely. However, there are many people that are anti-medication that are scared to take medications, not only for insomnia but also for other medical conditions. Look what we are experiencing in the USA with millions of people refusing to be vaccinated for Covid. Hospitals are being overwhelmed by these people when they get Covid. There's no need for this.

Again, I am not saying that prescriptions meds will work effectively for all people, but in my experience they do work for a great deal of people. Obviously, they work for US combat pilots that fly $250 million dollar aircraft into critical combat missions. This should open the minds of people, but the problem is that they heard from other anti-medication alarmists that prescription meds are bad.

What is worse than trying prescription medications for insomnia to see if they will work for you? Answer: Chronic, long-term insomnia that will snuff the joy out of lives, ruin families, ruin careers and ultimately shorten a life by causing a person to develop a deadly decrease. There are actually insomniacs that would rather die of complications of chronic insomnia than to ever take a pill that could turn their miserable life. Of course, when you explain this to people they get all flustered and angry because they are to scared of pills but at the same time they realize that this is true.

All you can do is lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink....."
7565,h8ydcml,,,insomnia,1628974683,ambien is like a benzo but jos not addictive as they are. The reduce the anxiety 100%. and put you to sleep. They are amazing drugs. Try not to use them often though.
7566,h8yczlx,,,insomnia,1628974519,Trazadone never worked for me and made it hard for me to breathe through my nose at night. Ambien only helped me at 20mg/night and I’m a 120lb female so that wasn’t ideal and I grew a tolerance quickly. Seroquel is the one medication that has helped with my insomnia long term.
7567,h8yca13,,,insomnia,1628974206,"Ok cool, I hope it helps! What else did they say? Were they reassuring?"
7568,h8ya6ij,,,insomnia,1628973250,what can i do to keep that from happening ?! should i take 5 mg tonight to start or ten ? im not a chronic insomniac but im having horrible anxiety and panic attacks centered around sleeping

7571,h8y8rz0,,,insomnia,1628972617,I have to try the Ativan.  Should help with the anxiety too.  If you dont see me on here tonight you’ll know it worked.
7572,h8y61c7,,,insomnia,1628971363,"it is a common side effect of this drugs, especially when there is no previous tolerance.

7576,h8y3nin,,,insomnia,1628970266,"Thanks — yea, seems like it. One minorly unpleasant thing that happened was I dozed off and then woke up only a few minute later because my head was falling forward. That wouldn’t happen at home, supine on my couch!

7580,h8y1btf,,,insomnia,1628969201,"Yep I was awake nearly 8 days (well, maybe 1 hour to sleep per night) and I felt so horrible. Somehow it got better after exactly 8 nights."
7581,h8y13zd,,,insomnia,1628969101,Makes sense. I’ve been taking 3mg nightly for years and it doesn’t really do anything so I want to try to cut back.
7582,h8y0xkb,,,insomnia,1628969017,Thanks — I was wondering whether I’d become physically and mentally so diminished from poor sleep that flying might be too much for me. Anyway I flew and it was okay.
7583,h8y0c3d,,,insomnia,1628968741,"Hospital usually can’t do much about sleep. Ask your primary care as a starting point.

I had a horrible 7 days of hardly any sleep (1 hour per night) a few years ago. I went to the hospital and they did an exam (bloodwork, ekg, etc) and they said I’m fine and sent me on my way. Two days later I started melatonin and was able to sleep normal enough after that to recover quickly. I don’t know if it was the melatonin that did the trick since melatonin doesn’t help me much lately."

Ambien and Ativan can have long term health consequences you want to make sure your aware of. Also don’t take ambien and Ativan together they affect the same receptors and for me it caused cross tolerance so they both stopped working
7598,h8xopxe,,,insomnia,1628963551,"Trazodone blocked my nostrils, did nothing for sleep.

Ambien works great for me 5mg works ok, 10mg always does the trick. A very important point with ambien is that it needs to be taken on an empty stomach by empty i mean nothing for at least 3 hours, otherwise it does nothing."

So even if you struggle to fall asleep for a few days it’s natural and happens to everyone at some point in their lives :). Insomnia can have many different causes but it sounds like the change in your schedule has just disrupted your natural pattern a bit. I know it’s irritating being tired all the time, especially since it sounds like you consistently get plenty of sleep, but the best thing you can do is make sure that you have good sleep hygiene and just try your best  to sleep. Also try your best to maintain a good routine to let your brain know it’s time to sleep. If it doesn’t get better in a few weeks maybe let your parents know that you’re struggling and they could help you see a doctor :)))). To help slow those racing thoughts down, I’ve always found that by doing some writing, drawing, colouring in or even reading is a good way to stop that brain going at hyper speed. Good luck!!!!"

I’ve had friends try to give me advice though and it makes me furious. Unless you’ve been there, don’t even bother trying to explain the things I can do to help my insomnia. And if I’m tired and someone tries to “help” with unsolicited advice, I flip on a mfer."
7605,h8xgny9,,,insomnia,1628960087,"Ashwagandha user here for the past 8 months. This supplement is amazing and it's actually helping me in a lot of aspects of my life, not only with sleeping better throughout the night, but I'm also handling stressful situations way better (I don't panic or freeze anymore) and my general anxiety is way more controlled.

That being said, things aren't that simple when talking about Ashwagandha. There are way too many brands selling it and it comes in all forms and shapes, which could be a good thing but unfortunately it's not, since most of those brands don't test their products in a lab, or even worse, they add fillers and all sorts of additives to their capsules, giving people some nasty side effects sometimes.

You want to do your research if you decide to take it, and look for a brand that uses a KSM66 root extract, with about 5% withanolides, and absolutely no fillers or additives whatsoever. Even better if it's lab tested."

7608,h8xezgi,,,insomnia,1628959365,"The human body and brain is much more resilient than you think, it won't get ruined that easily. Some people are naturally short sleepers. Try crying, put on a sad Disney cartoon or sad story until you cry, it's a form of release and will make you feel a little better. Do it regularly, and drink enough water during the day. And if you dream when you sleep, when you wake up and want to go back to sleep think about the dream you had and try to return to the story and world in your dream. And if you can't sleep for enough hours just mimic sleeping and lay comfortably to rest your body until you get up. Hope it gets better for you."

Get enough exercise, don’t consume caffeine or other stimulants after noon, white noise (and pink noise, and brown noise) can help drown out noise-based distractions.

7618,h8x33t7,,,insomnia,1628954224,Antidepressants are notorious for causing insomnia and sleep disturbances.  The mechanisms of action prevent REM sleep and deep sleep needed for brain and muscle recovery.  Prescribers know this and may prescribe another drug for sleep like Trazodone.  Both drugs have withdrawal ramifications after 4 weeks of use.  https://selfhacked.com/blog/5-ht2c/

Recently the Ambien does not work as well, so I have been switched to 1 mg Lunesta. Does not do much for me, I get about 1 to 2 hours sleep and wake up, then I take a Ativan and get 3 to 4 more hours of sleep. I was just started on Zoloft about 11 days ago and hoping this sleeping patter adjust. With just the Ambien I was sleeping 6-7 hours a night. I miss those days."

7622,h8x24qj,,,insomnia,1628953786,Hey there :) you cant train yourself not to sleep. I dont thunk you have primary insomnia but more of a side effect of your anxiety disorder. It comes with a disturbed bodyfeeling (depersonalisation) which can sometimes cause the waking up (for me at least). Maybe you should talk to a doctor about your fear. What pills did you use ?
7623,h8x1as7,,,insomnia,1628953412,Get back on a schedule and try not to nap during the day.  Watching videos till 4am isn’t going sleep hygiene.  You may want to ask your pharmacist for an over the counter sleep aids to help you get back on schedule.  Research good sleep hygiene.  It may take a week to get your circadian rhythm back on track.
7624,h8wysae,,,insomnia,1628952271,"Man thats fucking awful, I'm sorry this happened. I'd be livid too. Thankfully my mom is very understanding and even feels bad if she accidentally wakes me up (doesnt stop her from vacuuming at 11pm though) or asks whens the last time I slept, etc. but my sister couldnt care less and its frustrating when people lack that empathy right to your face.

Hopefully your mom is acting out of ignorance and she really does care but it still sucks. I relate a lot to crying due to the lack of sleep, it feels like you're going to die or go insane and someone invalidating it or not caring about that stings a bit.

I think the worst part of it is that many people feel like they also have had insomnia because they couldnt sleep right for a couple days or something when the reality of actually having it is utter hell. They fail to recognize it as a real issue that cant be fixed by ""just go to bed earlier!"".  I've seriously considered not letting anyone in my house sleep too so they could get a glimpse of how awful it is but I know how shitty it feels so I cant bring myself to do that. Anyway, its enough to feel like shit because you cant sleep and on top of that everything else starts to fall apart too. 

Also, please don't feel bad about cancelling, you're entitled to put yourself and your health first, I know thats difficult but dont let the guilt of that ruin the day you have for yourself. You're doing the right thing. I think if you're honest and up front about it, they should be able to respect that because you actually want to give them the time and attention that they deserve too. Imagine you went and fell asleep there or werent able to focus, were half assing stuff etc, that would be a bit rude no? Idk but I hope you're able to get some sleep soon!"

7656,h8w9arq,,,insomnia,1628936672,Thanks.  I took a trazadone and zquil last night.  Ambien the night before and still no sleep.  Heavy stuff.  Wondering if i should check in to hospital?
7657,h8w8tww,,,insomnia,1628936263,I usually take something at that point. Usually if I take something like benadryl or nighquil I can sleep for a few hours at least. I'm also a stay at home mom right now so I have the benefit of being a zombie at home with nothing to really do.
7658,h8w8bez,,,insomnia,1628935810,Just curious how you go with the flow after 3 days of no sleep?  I can barely focus or concentrate.  Anxiety through the roof and pdoc not getting back to me.
7659,h8w7yt9,,,insomnia,1628935499,"If you can let go the fear will fade away. This helped me a lot. Just dont try to sleep but watch tv instead the whole night. Tomorrow you will go to a doctor or psychiatrist but for today, just focus on watching tv :) this made me sleep hours and hours"
7660,h8w6f1t,,,insomnia,1628934115,I’ve been awake all night too and feel like I’m not going to get any sleep either. I wish you the best of luck.

Try this, put it on low volume and let it put your mind to ease.

My brain doesn't want to sleep so I'll punish it by getting up and reading a book, drinking some tea. I can't control it so I might as well accept it for tonight. Setting myself up for a challenge every night didn't help, but rather get into a routine and accept those nights where I couldn't sleep with as little emotion as possible. I accept this isn't a solution for everyone, and medication might be needed for some people."
7663,h8w3jsr,,,insomnia,1628931581,Modern life is like this. Just truly to say “fuck it” and realize you a couple bad nights of sleep is something you’ll get through

But I’m sure it’s fine. Just be sure to check in if he wants to or not. Because eventually he’ll probably want to sleep uninterrupted."

7670,h8vytbn,,,insomnia,1628927591,I may be experiencing something similar right now. It’s 2:00 in the morning for me and I feel that I haven’t been to sleep at all. Yet it’s possible that I fall asleep for a few minutes at a time and then wake up again.
7671,h8vysj8,,,insomnia,1628927573,stress was initial cause then later even without i sleep very lightly till now
7672,h8vxrka,,,insomnia,1628926736,i am not deep sleeping that is problem that is what affected my brain and body i felt all painful symptoms
7673,h8vxpqy,,,insomnia,1628926697,"Well as you know, quitting alcohol often leada to rebound insomnia. I am in the same boat, in a way. I started drinking to help me sleep, and I know that once I quit I will have huge trouble sleeping. Which is why it's so hard to quit. 
No pill worked as well as booze to get me to sleep. Sadly, the sleep I get is shitty and the whole thing is not sustainable in the long run."

7677,h8vx9oi,,,insomnia,1628926333,"Fear of bed is very common. When I was going through my first major bout of insomnia, I developed just that. Thinking about sleep all day, dreading the night and being hyperalert come bedtime.

What can I say, the first time I was going through it, I eventually learned to develop a ""fuck it"" attitude and the thing went away, took me half a year or more. 

The same attitude is not helping anymore, since my insomnia is now more of the maintenance variety, but maybe you can try the whole acceptance thing, there is a lot of info about that online. I can say first hand that it had worked for me once, and I slept relatively well for years later (one or two rough nights per week, others at least 6 hours a night), until the damned thing returned in another form.

Good luck, it is tough, for sure."
7678,h8vwqf0,,,insomnia,1628925890,"They say depression IS the most common reason for maintenance insomnia, other than sleep apnea, so... yeah."

7684,h8vk9x6,,,insomnia,1628916824,yes i can relate.. and here's to you getting though work today 💪
7685,h8vjvge,,,insomnia,1628916574,"it's possible, i think. the pandemic definitely messed with my sleep. it also made me isolated in my head for an extended period of time and made me depressed and anxious and all of that stuff combined is making my sleep worse."
7686,h8vjfn8,,,insomnia,1628916300,"i honestly have never had any bad side effects from trazodone. I've been taking it on and off for about 20 years. never a single side effect. the only problem i ever have is that it stops working if i take it all the time, so i am staying on a low dose this time and skipping days. my friend said it made her drowsy in the morning so she won't take it. I've definitely heard other people say they don't like it, but it seems to work perfectly for me when i take it. it's weird how everyone is so different."
7687,h8vj6ey,,,insomnia,1628916133,"It does depend on you age, Benadryl (DPH) can cause dementia in old people when they take 50mg everyday for a long time. I assume that is people over the age of 50 or 60. I who had taken it for a long time at really high doses like 200mg-400mg and a couple times to 700mg and another one to over a 1000mg. Did not experience and memory problems or anything that has affected my health. That being said I am tolerant to it so just because I took 1000mg doesn’t mean I was affect by that dosage, that dosage felt like 200mg without the tolerance and I fully recovered within a matter of hours, where as years ago taking 300mg it would take me more than a day to recover. So since you’ve been taking a lot Benadryl most likely doesn’t affect you at all, other than cause vasoconstriction and decrease allergy symptoms. When I went scuba diving I took 100mg so my nostrils and ears would open up in order for me to equalize more easily, I did not feel any other effects other than the ears and nose clearing."
7688,h8vj1o8,,,insomnia,1628916051,"Im kinda scared taking meds after seeing some guy in youtube that using some sleep pills and then he unable to sleep after. Scary, thats why i want to find alternative way. But in this pandemic i did messing up with sleep habits. Like for about 6 months i used to sleep at 5-6am and then wake up at 4-5pm almost for months. Do you think that's cause of my insomnia now ?"
7689,h8viles,,,insomnia,1628915766,"i had to get a prescription for trazadone from my doctor. it works for me, but i didn't take it tonight or last night because i don't want it to stop working so i take breaks from it for a few days here and there. I've honestly tried everything. melatonin, over the counter sleep aids like zzzquil and benadryl, meditation haha.. melatonin actually helped for a while, but for me, i had to really do this ritual with it where i would take it like an hour before bed and then I'd have to do all these things to make myself relax like meditate and think happy thoughts haha.. trazadone just knocks me out in a half hour. usually, when i don't take my trazadone, i read or listen to YouTube documentaries or podcasts, but they have to be sort of boring or i wind up staying up to finish the story.. but even when i do finally fall asleep tonight, I'm going to not feel rested tomorrow. tomorrow night, I'm definitely taking the trazadone.."
7690,h8vhzyj,,,insomnia,1628915402,Tonight looks like a long night.  A documentary sounds good.  First some trazadone.
7691,h8vhss1,,,insomnia,1628915281,"Yes. I feel like i just doing some light sleep. Usually when u just wake up after sleep, you must feel that drowsy feeling right. That prevent you from waking up but its not the case for me. When i wake up thats it,There is no drowsy feeling something like that. Its the same feeling like when you prentending to sleep. I have no idea why it happened to me though. Any idea to get my drowsy feeling back ? Or the way to get into deep rem sleep ?"

7696,h8vg64c,,,insomnia,1628914310,i take trazadone and it does help me to sleep.. i should've taken it tonight 😩
7697,h8vg0gm,,,insomnia,1628914220,"i am in a similar situation. I'm interested in hearing what people have to say about this.. i have bad insomnia and take prescribed sleeping pills, but i can't take them every night because i build up a tolerance and then it gets crazy and nothing works. when i don't take them (tonight), it takes a long time to fall asleep and i pretty often i wake up at like 3am, but not always.. and same. even when i think i sleep 8 hours, it definitely doesn't feel like i did. i think i never hit that deep REM sleep stage. i must partially wake up without realizing it or remembering it in the morning.. tomorrow night is definitely sleeping pill night."
7698,h8vdqyc,,,insomnia,1628912924,thats great thanks for informing me of that. now im not gonna worry about it. best of luck!
7699,h8vcsm6,,,insomnia,1628912394,"IU've taken it almost every night for years. I don't think I've ever taken more than 50mg, but I've been on 25mg for a while and am probably going to wean down to half a 25 soon."
7700,h8va442,,,insomnia,1628910949,I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I can’t imagine. My thoughts are with you
7701,h8v8gdj,,,insomnia,1628910091,I feel your pain! And hugging a pillow is as wholesome as it gets.
7702,h8v7io1,,,insomnia,1628909615,"Ok, I only mentioned this because judging by your first post it sounds like you're under some pretty chronic stress - and also that you believe nothing will work, and anticipate poor sleep which means even going to bed can be a bit of a stressor in itself.

Not sure how much of an anatomy and physiology background you have - you may even know more than me on this; but our nervous systems are quite sensitive to stress and pump out chemicals &amp; signals to the brain which make it hard to switch off for sleep.

I think seeing your doctor again would be really helpful, but since you can't and your parents are insisting you treat this on your own, maybe it would be worth looking into some resources to help you feel a bit better about the whole situation?

Some self help content could just help to think through what your options are, be more assertive with your parents if possible *and* hopefully even help you sleep better too. A good resource I know of is the anxiety Canada website which has a ""plan"" with 10min modules to work through in your own time. It's not specific to sleep and I'm not suggesting that you have anxiety. It's just something that I've used in the past to help get through hard insomnia times."
7703,h8v61hh,,,insomnia,1628908864,I don't think so. I work out in the afternoon and did so for a few months with no problem. All I did notice recently was that I was having muscle fasciculations troughout the day for a few days but it was on my rest days. My insomnia was anxiety induced so only if working out triggers my anxiety somehow.
7704,h8v5m0f,,,insomnia,1628908648,"Have you been using Seroquel every night or as needed? Im currently taking 25mg and had to up the dosage to 50mg so I was wondering whats the highest you've taken?

Also its such a relief to hear that you haven't had any side effects since thats always been one of my fears with medication lol"
7705,h8v3a3h,,,insomnia,1628907502,I'm not even gonna bother replying to that. Your stupidity is on another level. Good luck.
7706,h8v2qef,,,insomnia,1628907228,I sleep better when I hug my pillow.
7707,h8uzqg3,,,insomnia,1628905743,"I get it, I really do. Maybe over the counter can help get you through to a doctor visit?"
7708,h8uysbn,,,insomnia,1628905270,"It depends on age, and taking two Benadryl every night most likely doesn’t affect you at all. There was an experiment done on people they get them two Benadryl every night, the first two night they went to sleep quickly, the third, four, and fifth nights they didn’t sleep any better than the people who were not taking Benadryl because there bodies because tolerant to it quickly. 

I have a much worse problem than you, I have taken 200mg-400mg of Benadryl every night for the last 2 maybe 3 years, not every night but most nights. And honestly Benadryl does help me sleep because my body has gotten tolerance to it, only when I take above 400mg Benadryl just prevents me from going to sleep for 5 hours, but quoting is not hard, I sleep just as well at Benadryl than I do without it."
7709,h8uw7ie,,,insomnia,1628903989,Trazodone ended up giving me some severe anxiety. I won't be taking that again no matter how sleepless I get.

7711,h8utq5n,,,insomnia,1628902769,"That’s great! Wish I could have that attitude when I don’t sleep very long 😂 but honestly, it sounds like you’re getting it under control now anyways. You’ll surely have better nights pretty soon."
7712,h8utjk4,,,insomnia,1628902676,Thank you! I just discovered that i can function pretty ok with only 2-3 hours of sleep per night( atleast for now) so it s not that much of a problem now
7713,h8utanz,,,insomnia,1628902552,"Yea 2 weeks in you’re only going to notice awful side effects, but with mirtazapine there’s suppose to be no decrease in libido so that’s another plus.

7714,h8uszpt,,,insomnia,1628902401,"Only 2 weeks. Completly destroyed my libido while on it( tought i was asexual)  and  couldnt feel any kind of emotion.

7716,h8us31f,,,insomnia,1628901950,"How long were you on it for? You said your insomnia only started 2 months ago and that’s definitely not enough time to tell if a med like that is going to work or not. 

Personally, Zoloft didn’t work for me either (I was on it for four months) but I think mirtazapine would be a better fit for someone in your situation."
7717,h8us1cf,,,insomnia,1628901927,Mirtazapine has been my miracle drug for 3 years now. I pray to that ahah. It takes a few weeks or months to get adjusted to it though. Definetly worth it for me!

I've experienced that latelly, and i've had a similar insomnia phase of 5 months were i lost weight as well. I've been sleeping well for the past 2 years now and whenever i start working out early in the morning, or having an alarm early, i start having bad sleep. Did you experience something like that? Anyway, i get how scared you are, my insomnia phase was so traumatic that anytime i start sleeping bad i freak out."
7720,h8uret2,,,insomnia,1628901617,"Why not try a antidepressant since it seems like your depression/anxiety is the root cause? 

Perhaps mirtazapine? Seems like it’s easier to start compared to most other antidepressants and it helps with sleep."
7721,h8uqe3g,,,insomnia,1628901118,"You just have to find one doctor who believes you. There is not much that can be done in terms of treatment anyway. 

You can try with GPs, maybe you get lucky and one will believe. Otherwise you would have to look for a neurologist who is into circadian disorders. For example you could google with universities / doctors work in that field in your country."
7722,h8uo49k,,,insomnia,1628899996,Well it’s currently 8 pm here so I don’t have a way to call my doctor. I messaged my psychiatrist yesterday and she never called or messaged me back today before her office closed. I went in patient a few days ago but still couldn’t sleep while I was in patient. My anxiety is just really terrible and I don’t know how to get it under control. 😭
7723,h8unfsu,,,insomnia,1628899666,"Do you have a general practitioner you can talk to, relatively quickly? Have you considered an over-the-counter sleep aid? A lot of us insomniacs have been where you are. I personally have never gone to the ER, but I'm sure I've considered it. Good thing is, I've always been able to get pretty good aid from my healthcare professionals. Maybe a small prescription for Zolpidem or something? ***I am not a doctor, of course!***"
7724,h8umcb4,,,insomnia,1628899138,"Yeah I know. That's what I asked about in the end of my post. I just don't know who to see. Currently I plan on going through our government system, which is free, and I'll see if they can help me.

Took me a while to ween off everything.  First started with stopping drinking.  Then slowly cutting back on Xanax, oh yea I was also on some anti depressant too.  Got off that too and cut back my ambien to half a pill and added half a pill of seroquel and that has kept me in a good space.

Feel normal but just can’t seem to ever get totally off things."
7727,h8ujavj,,,insomnia,1628897691,"Sigh. Gabapentin used to work wonders. Now it doesn't work at all, even if I crank up the dosage. Maybe I'll try a good old-fashioned CBT approach."

7729,h8uiowq,,,insomnia,1628897405,I didn’t notice getting dry mouth when on Trazodone (on it for two weeks at 50mg) but I did notice it on Amitriptyline. I’m taking that every other night now and I don’t notice that I don’t get dry mouth. I feel thirsty when I wake up but it doesn’t last long after I drink.
7730,h8uffkj,,,insomnia,1628895903,oh thats not good
7731,h8uf3eg,,,insomnia,1628895749,"Trazadone sucks but I’m good with 25mg seroquel and 5mg ambien.

Without that I can’t sleep a wink.  Believe me I’ve tried.

It used to be worse tho I used to be on 1mg+ Xanax / 12.5 mg ambien CR and alcohol every night before bed.  That was a dangerous combo!

I say don’t chase sleep, easier said than done.  If my combo still doesn’t give me good sleep I don’t chase it with more pills and I know don’t drink like that anymore.

Good luck!"

Yes, the US military uses sleeping pills and I'd say that's a rather insightful thing to know. Obviously the sleep medications work and are safe for the pilots.

If sleeping pills really don't work for you, then what is next? CBT-i? MELATONIN?? REALLY??? Good luck with those things.

Meditation;
Exercise (strenuous and laid-back);

Certain kinds of tea;
Music suitable for sleeping;
White noise;
Binaural beats;

I have anxiety disorder, you might have one too, even though you say you're not thinking of anything you might be stressing about not being able to sleep. What worked for me is not caring about sleep. Just focus on the things you can control like eating healthy to not have a vitamin or mineral deficiency and good sleep hygene. Leave sleep to your brain to decide. Literally stop caring about it and carry on the best you can. You haven't ruined anything trust me."

Yes, try tapering if you have the will power and energy. it will be hard but worth it. Look for a support community online. Those people also can share better tips how to withdraw from ambien in the best possible way when Diazepam is not an option. 

For example i know about people who dissolve ambien and then just take a certain amount of an oral solution to make fine dose adjustments but mostly the short half-life of Ambien will kick you into some kind of withdraw, no matter what. 

At least it is only Ambien and 10 mg is doable. 

You also might have an easier time managing the withdraw if you stop the amphtamines. Taking amphetamines while on withdraw from Benzo-like drugs is kind of nasty. i certainly would stop the ADHD medication completely until after the withdraw is done and then see how you sleep. 

Low dose Seroquel, Abilify and Cloazapine can also be solutions in severe cases of insomina.

Ehat about th 50 mg Lamotrigine? is it supposed to stay at that dose? 

Lots of drugs you are taking!"

And my cycling coach wants me to fit in a ride, which I'm stuck with having to stick that in before the physio apt because I shouldn't exercise after seeing the physio. Also, the average person being awake during the day, if anyone is around they make a huge noise during my sleep. I have decent earplugs, but they only work so well at cutting out the sound. And then people go open my door and the light Wales me up. I have an eye mask on order for that one.

Not saying this will happen to you, but definitely wean off of it. I didn't think I needed to, as I was on a relatively low dose I think, and again, didn't feel like it had been doing much of anything anyway.

If so you might need to explore ways to calm your mind. It is not rocket science, but it isn’t extremely easy either. 

Meditation every day helps. Especially before bed. It won’t be an immediate fix though. 

Look into “cognitive restructuring for insomnia.” It’s all about retraining your brain to avoid certain negative thoughts about sleep and replace them with positive ones. 

YouTube “yoga nidra” and click the first one that pops up. Try it during the day (about 20 min) to see how it relaxes you. Then take that experience into bed. Try it before sleeping perhaps, but without any expectations."

-	And the biggest one: don’t go to bed until I’m exhausted. I used to go to bed super early because I thought that’s what made sense if you value sleep. Turns out it just leads to laying in bed awake for hours, getting frustrated, and developing a negative association with my bed and sleep."

Post helpful tips that will help people get necessary care.  You're taking 3 drugs to sleep, I think Ambien, Seroquel and benzos, with redosing in the night during wake up (I remember reading that a while ago).  Not everyone can do this or wants to if you read all the posts here.

I got Ambien Cr along with setraline (sorry spelling).  That helped me sleep through a night for the first time.  If my medicine is ever not filled I am up late like very late.

7881,h8qk7kr,,,insomnia,1628822757,"i just recently made a post about my insomnia begging for help. i’ve gone through the EXACT same thing for 4 years. i know everybody is different but i finally figured out what was causing my circadian rhythm to be so f’d up. like i said, my sleep schedule was doing the EXACT same thing as yours. i wouldn’t fall asleep until 9am and i would wake up at 12. and if i was lucky i would fall asleep at around 4 and wake up at 11. i would go 2-3 days without sleeping then finally crash. this took a toll on me because i wanted to go to sleep early and wake up at 4 to go workout which i could never do because i couldn’t fall asleep. my insomnia has gone and came for the past 4 years and i realized it would come everytime i was on break for school. somebody responded to my post and said i can’t fix it by going to sleep earlier, i needed to wake up earlier. so, for the past week i forced myself to wake up at 7am even after falling asleep at 4am. someone said it’s very important to wake up at the same time. and this made me realize that that’s the reason my insomnia comes during school breaks because i would stay up late and then wake up late at different times. i finally fixed my sleep schedule by waking up at the same time everyday and for the past 4 days, for the first time in my life, i have been going to sleep at 9pm and waking up at 7am. i guess mg advice is to not sleep from 9-12, try to set a time to get up even after not sleeping and you’ll be tired enough to fall asleep and then keep waking up at that same time and hopefully it will work for you like it did for me. praying for you because i know the pain 🙏🏽"

I may have slept more but it’s the kind of sleep you get when you’re drunk. You don’t necessarily feel rested in the morning. The thing that finally worked for me (way better than benzos or ambien) was a hot cup of tea and a good book…Just kidding, it was seroquel. It has been the only medication to get my lifelong insomnia under control. Been on it for something like six years now and I’ve been able to slowly lower my dose over time! Started at 300mg (which is a lot) now I’m at ~10mg and I feel extremely well. I can even nap in the day and still sleep well at night. Worth a shot :)

But if you really want benzos, I’d go the anxiety/panic attack route. It’s not advised to prescribe them for sleep so many physicians won’t."

It's important to find out if it's psychological insomnia or not.

I usually say the tips I give might work or might not, but one thing is for sure, they can't hurt you. For example exercise is generally good for all of us on some level. As is a safe home environment to sleep in etc. 

I do more running ecercixe while my partner lifts. We have different motivations needs and goals and I think it's up to each of us to costumize the exercise to be as fun and motivating as possible. I do agree that outside activities is great! Forests are magic for our well being."

Anxiety based insomnia, which I believe describes the majority of insomnia cases (certainly describes me), is one of the toughest conditions to treat. Some people are helped with exercise, some with prayer, meds, some with just acceptance and coming to terms with the thing. For some nothing works, and for most of us whatever we find works for a while, then we have to move on to something else.

Exercise is good in any case. With that in mind, I think insomnia sufferers should avoid strenuous exercise (lifting weights, for instance), and strive more to do aerobic exercise and generally spend a lot of time in the sun and outdoors. Chronic insomnia is heavy on the heart, that is important to keep in mind when choosing the type of exercise."

7936,h8ouxcf,,,insomnia,1628795692,"Always had poor habits as well. Made a mistake at work and i talked to my boss about taking 2 days off to fix my sleep since i was taking benadryl often(contract work/chill boss) was sleeping from 3/5am to 10am. For the next 6 days i didn not sleep due to sleep anxiety(kept with my shitty habits but went to bed at 11pm). I could not function and quit. This was  10 days ago and ive only been able to sleep 5-6 hrs some nights with ambien. Ive got some underlying mental issues that were neglected which may contribute, but im going to see the sleep doc friday, played google dr and now ive worsened my anxiety lol"
7937,h8ou681,,,insomnia,1628795353,"I’ve read this several times.  You’re disposition, attitude, perhaps lack of self care as I see there’s drug use/abuse, not caring that sleep cause is as vital as food, water and oxygen. Maybe it’s something like not caring about thriving in life is for a lack of a better word, which is disconcerting.  Just an observation.  

Everything in life is about choices, we make choices every day from the most mundane things to setting goals.  Your sleep problems are a side effect of life’s choices."
7938,h8osnzx,,,insomnia,1628794678,Not to malign your doctor but that runs counter to the most reliable contemporary advice. General practitioners aren't usually equipped to deal with insomnia. You might also like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ) video from a Stanford prof.
7939,h8oqf8w,,,insomnia,1628793640,"I think your attitude to sleep by hating it is the problem.  the best thing for you would be therapy, as using meds long term daily as you seem to know isn't sustainable. 

You need to break that mental hate of sleep and meds won't do that. A psychiatrist would be a good start."
7940,h8oq9ol,,,insomnia,1628793567,"I’m struggling with this a lot too. I’m supposed to wake up at 5:30 every day for work and normally that’s when I start to doze off after waking up at 2-3am. Something that has been helping me is the moment I wake up I take 2 magnesium vitamins (at the advise of my colleague who’s a doctor). It doesn’t work every time, but it does help me fall back asleep on occasions and stay asleep for a relatively good amount of time. You also can’t overdo magnesium so it’s nice and safe"
7941,h8opmyw,,,insomnia,1628793275,Thankyou. I was doing it at the advise of my doctor. He said to allow an hour in bed before falling asleep and allowing the 9 hour period to sleep as regularly waking up usually gets me about 7 hours maximum in that time frame. I’ve struggled with this my entire life and allowing the 10 hours is something new I introduced to my routine - I used to go to bed as late as possible but it just wasn’t feasible with the periodic waking up. Although I do find myself falling asleep quicker if I don’t try going to bed an hour beforehand - so perhaps it’s time to drop the melatonin routine 🤷🏻‍♀️
7942,h8oo1c6,,,insomnia,1628792548,"No You dont go to the ER for 5 hours or sleep for only 5 days , thats a complete waste of time and money for them and people that need real help.
Call your fking doc and make an appointment for christ sake .."
7943,h8onkro,,,insomnia,1628792358,"Ambien is a strong medicine but it works very short duration so it’s typically prescribed to patience who has the trouble to fall asleep. In the case you can’t sleep a decent while, you need long duration medicines such as Ethyl loflazepate, Flunitrazepam, or Quazepam. They are usually benzodiazepines which get you addicted easily, if you’d like medication though.
I wouldn’t take medications for a difficulty staying sleep because it’s way better than no sleeping. As I’ve been insomniac for 30 years, I’d be able to work decently a day with 3 hours sleeping. It would be just exhausting not impossible."
7944,h8okzop,,,insomnia,1628791300,How much time are you spending in bed? Are you hot/cold?

7946,h8okouw,,,insomnia,1628791180,"Ok, around 8.5h in bed. That's not bad but you might benefit from restricting that to 7.5-8h to consolidate sleep. 

You'll feel hotter in bed if you've delayed your onset time. Most people fall asleep during the steepest drop toward circadian temperature minimum. At this time your melatonin also spikes, and your cortisol drops. If you're getting excess stimulation or bright light exposure right before bed, it can delay all of the above. 

You can also try layering sheets or using moisture-wicking sheets to beat the heat. 

Check out [this](https://insomniasos.net/) guide."
7947,h8ok68a,,,insomnia,1628790978,"Ok. 7:30pm to 5:30 am makes for 10 whole hours in bed. That excess easily leads to both onset and maintenance insomnia. Assuming you keep getting up at 5:30 am, then try going to bed at 9:30 pm or even later. You can also make use of bright light in the morning and some wind-down routines for the evening, as in the guide."
7948,h8ofify,,,insomnia,1628789129,"Same here. I wake up every hour, and sometimes twice in an hour. A good dose of Clonazepan can help me to sleep all night, but i dont recommend it at all. I just use this crap when i am in panic mode. Going to try some teas and meditation now."

7954,h8od4tz,,,insomnia,1628788174,"Correct, have used them for insomnia a few days a month when it's at its worst to get some sleep. Definitely not an everyday drug as you rightly say benzo withdrawal is hell. 

A few times a month helps me cope, even then Benzo's mess with your sleep cycle so I may get 8 hours sleep I never wake up feeling refreshed, always a bit of a groggy hangover feeling for an hour, but it's better than no sleep. If anyone has an addictive personality then stay well away from Benzo's."
7955,h8ocx91,,,insomnia,1628788089,"They are not going to do that, even if you haven't slept at all in a week. The ER is for emergencies not people who want to sleep more than 5 hrs 🤦...the ER is there to keep you alive or stable until a specialist can see you. I'm pretty sure you're just a teenager after drugs at this point. Not to mention no Dr. Out there will do that after the whole Michael Jackson fiasco 🤦🤦🤦"
7956,h8ocrpo,,,insomnia,1628788026,"No not straight away,  there's usually a 15 minute period where I try and get back to sleep."
7957,h8obkmy,,,insomnia,1628787546,do you immediately get on your phone after you wake up?
7958,h8ob07a,,,insomnia,1628787321,Benzos might help you “sleep” but massively disrupt your sleep architecture. Be careful with them. It would be easier for your doctor to just prescribe the benzos for you as requested but there must be reasons why he/she is so hesitant: likely other patients who had very bad experiences as well as the evidence linking benzos to dementia.
7959,h8o8nwo,,,insomnia,1628786387,Sorry just saw this. I do both. I went to someone ten days ago and I kid you not I have not had insomnia since. We dealt with some childhood trauma. there is also an app called the tapping solution and they offer a bunch of insomnia meditations.
7960,h8o7fup,,,insomnia,1628785897,"Struggling with insomnia your whole life; slowly getting worse = seeing a doctor.  Your insomnia sounds like complete torture.  How did the 5 days in April resolve?  The body naturally needs sleep and you can sleep.  You’re getting micro sleeps, most likely not realizing they are happening or fighting the urge to sleep when they happen. 

Its affecting your quality of life, you’re feeling depressed and not sleeping and sleep deprivation only acerbates symptoms like mood, anxiety, etc."
7961,h8o71fy,,,insomnia,1628785736,"Sorry for the ""whitty"" resonse earlier. It's supposedly Hitchcock's answer to insomnia cures.

Exercise never helped me sleep, sadly, though it did make me feel better, and it does make sense that it should work. It is hard to make yourself do it when you're exhausted, though.

Maybe it has something to do with regular insomnia vs. anxiety induced one, who knows. 

In any case everyone should try it, that's for sure."
7962,h8o6icb,,,insomnia,1628785524,"Been an insomniac since I was 15 (28 now) so yeah, tried drugs, tried Z drugs even but nothing worked and usually between 2300 and 0100 though I've tried basically every time"
7963,h8o56v2,,,insomnia,1628784998,"Lotta things can trigger wake after sleep onset.  Some of the easier things to correct:  need to pee as someone noted above, and low blood sugar.  Google “nocturnal hypoglycemia”.  You can get a blood glucose monitor for pretty cheap on Amazon...you don’t need anything fancy because presumably you wouldn’t be using it all the time like a diabetic.  When you wake, check your glucose levels.  If it’s below 70, that may be your culprit.  If so, then eating something before bed can smooth that out.  Especially stuff that will have a low glycemic index and hit your blood stream slowly.  Lot of advice on the inter-webs about this  

Night time cortisol spikes are another culprit.  You’d need a multi-time point salivary cortisol test for that.  DM me if you want more info about that.  

Sleep apnea is another thing that can cause night-waking.  Sleep study is gold standard, but you can get a hint if that’s the issue with a good fitness tracker that monitors respiration and SpO2.  Some sleep apps on your phone can also listen for snoring and abnormal breathing. 

Restless leg syndrome (worse on the front end of sleep), or period limb movement disorder (PLMD, all night) which is excessive limb movement during sleep, can also cause sleep disruption.  A fitness tracker that measures movement at night (most of them do this, usually scored as awake time) can help you know if that’s the issue. 

Me:  I’ve ruled out all the obvious night-waking causes, so I take meds now.  Doxepin at 3-6 mg is effective for sleep maintenance insomnia.  I haven’t found generic Doxy in sizes less that 10 mg, so I just take a little extra.  It’s a tricyclic antidepressant at much higher doses.  At 10 mg and below, it’s a very selective insomnia drug. This is one of the few meds I’ve ever taken that works as advertised.  When I take doxy, I sleep through the night.  When I don’t, I don’t.  I e taken it for 3 years and so far I haven’t developed any tolerance.  Same dose keeps working.  Let me know if you want any scientific refs on the efficacy of doxepin.  

Good luck! Hope this helps and may you soon be sleeping well."
7964,h8o414w,,,insomnia,1628784523,No. Just try it
7965,h8o2s3u,,,insomnia,1628784007,"Back in my druggie days I did a 6 day speed binge. It gives me anxiety to type that out due to how fucking stupid it was. 

Day 5 I hit amphetamine psychosis, voices in the walls, wild hallucinations in dim light. In hindsight it might have actually been a necessary experience. The realizations I had from the change in perception actually is what motivated me to get sober. 

Sober, I once went through a cycle of 2 days, then a couple hours of sleep on the 3rd night. That cycle repeated itself for a good week or two."

In any case, 7 hours in bed seemed to help reduce my 6 nightly wakeups to 3. Lately I’ve been in bed 8+ hours per night and my wakeups are back up to 6. Ugh."
7968,h8o1yal,,,insomnia,1628783671,"This is anecdotal, but a friend of mine got on xanax for anxiety, also sleep problems. She took it every day and it eventually stopped working for both problems so she had to up her dose. 

She is now pretty hardcore addicted to benzos. I've been through opiate withdrawal but it sounds like a cake walk compared to the horror stories I've heard of benzo withdrawal. 

Should you get on this stuff, do not take it every night. You'd rather get some nights of sleep followed by some nights of shitty sleep rather than sleeping every night and developing a pretty nasty dependency. Just my opinion."

7970,h8nzvuy,,,insomnia,1628782820,4-5 hours of sleep isn’t ideal but I highly doubt it’s an emergency. Plenty of people on this sub get way less than that and for longer periods of time. It would be good to talk to your PCP and/or a sleep specialist to see what’s going on.

7973,h8ny003,,,insomnia,1628782039,"To add to other comment, keto does lower alcohol tolerance, so he had more alcohol blood alcohol level as the body stores carbohydrates as glycogen, and during ketosis, there are very low levels of it.  Low levels of glycogen mean that there are fewer substances in your body to absorb alcohol. Carbohydrates can reduce blood alcohol levels.

Start off with wanting to try 1 x 10mg Temazepam each week on the same day for 5 weeks and see if they'll just write a script for 5 tablets. Have an appointment lined up for you to discuss your results, and if it's working or not then what you'll try next (if T isn't working, trying 0.5mg X for 5 weeks, if T is working, try twice a week on the same days to see if that works better or worse). Once you've got to an optimum usage level, let them know you want to run with that for 6 months and get a script to cover it. They might suggest some other options or plans for trying it out, but I think this is a reasonable place to suggest that you start. If they won't give it to you, go to another doctor and advise them the same. I'd be surprised if they don't do something to help you try to find what works. Oh, and they might consider Z-class options lily e Zolpidem or Zopiclone - they work in a similar way, so give them a go or include in your plan of attack.

They have the opposite effect. If you just started these meds and then this insomnia started, I would talk to your doctor about getting a gene mutation test done and see how that goes. I have a gene mutation and antidepressants very literally make me suicidal and I didn’t figure that out until the 7th antidepressant in. It was a scary ride. Im so so sorry you’re going through this. I’ve been through it as well. I was having 18 hour work days with 1 year old twins as a single mom with no help and maybe 20 mins of sleep a night because of the meds. Pls call your dr tomorrow and see about getting that test. I know there are supplements that can help the mutation if you end up having it."

8022,h8n5urf,,,insomnia,1628768362,me too i tried many things nothing worked i just light sleep whole night no deep sleep at all my insomnia started because of exams and project anxiety more than 8 to 10 months ago
8023,h8n566e,,,insomnia,1628767926,"Maybe talk to your healthcare provider about trying a prescription? I just got prescribed a low dose of hydroxyzine to take as needed for anxiety and that has helped me with my insomnia. Not saying you should try the same thing, but it’s definitely worth a conversation with your provider or maybe even a therapist. You could have some underlying mental health issues that have begun as a result of the pandemic that can have negative effects on your ability to fall asleep at night. Sometimes just recognizing those new issues (if you even have them) is helpful for alleviating insomnia. 

I don’t want to suggest trying things you’ve already tried, but sleep meditations or sleep stories have also helped me in the past. Also we just started going back into the office at my work and knowing I have to be somewhere not only in the morning, but all day long has mentally been a game changer. When we were remote, I think I was subconsciously telling myself I could sleep whenever so it didn’t matter if I was up until 5am (especially if I was doing something I felt was productive). It sounds like you’ve been prioritizing sleep though, so that second part might not be as relevant to you.

Just a note: everything suggested above is based on my own experiences and conversations with my provider and therapist. It’s mostly anecdotal, but hoping maybe to give you some ideas. Lying awake in bed for hours is one of the most frustrating things. I hope you are able to get some sleep relief soon!"

8058,h8mnm8u,,,insomnia,1628753609,Thankyou for this. I adore my job but I sadly think you might be right. The only other time in my life my insomnia was so bad I was going days without sleep was when I was needing to wake up at 5:30 for school because I lived so far away. It always starts off with me being able to push through it but then it starts to hit the 6+ month mark and I turn into a walking zombie. I think a lifestyle of getting up so early just isn’t possible :(
8059,h8mnfyf,,,insomnia,1628753458,"Thankyou for this. Anxiety definitely plays a big part in it, I often finding myself checking for a clock the second I wake up lately out of fear that it’s gonna be “one of those nights” again. I’ve been working through it with my doctor but it’s been hard due to being 21 and doctors being very hesitant to put me on any medication, currently I’m on the lowest dose of melatonin possible and am struggling to even convince him to up that as he’s concerned my morning driving will be affected. I’ve never actually heard anybody say the words maintenance insomnia, so I’ll have to look into that more as from what I’m reading now that seems to be exactly what it is. A lot of doctors keep giving me solutions to fall asleep but I seriously have no issues with that part"

I just power through my days. I’ve gone multiple days of no sleep and very little sleep 2-4 hours. On my days off is where I can get 5 or 6 hours and that’s enough to get me by. 

5:30am is every early though. If it’s affecting your sleep that much, it might be time to find a new job that’s afternoon. I’ve had to adjust my job later in the afternoon as well. Don’t be ashamed to quit if you have to. Make sure to line up a job first."
8064,h8mmkiv,,,insomnia,1628752739,"Your doctor is right to try everything before just going to stronger sleeping meds or Benzo's.

I have used the for close to 15 years, initially every night. After working with psychiatrist on things we got to a regime that works. I take the Benzo's for 2or3 night is a row to get a good sleep pattern, this would usually be ok for 3 or 4 weeks then when insomnia gets unbearable repeat. 

So Benzo's are lifesavers but the flip side is they can also can destroy lives. Anyone with an addictive personality should stay away.  The also shouldn't be taken every night for insomnia as your tolerance will build so need to up the dose etc and will become physically addicted to them. Which if you were ever going to stop is going to be hell as benzo withdrawal can literally be fatal."
8065,h8mm3e5,,,insomnia,1628752347,"Hello, 

Woah woah woah let’s take that trampoline away firstly :’)

You can get a larger quantity prescribed from a specialist e.g. psychiatrist as you stated that’s correct. Although I have also been offered it from a GP, so it isn’t entirely as forbidden as you may think. My Xanax is genuinely prescribed to me to be taken as and when needed, so is the codeine and melatonin. 

But you’re correct I shouldn’t be taking this combination at once because of CNS depression risk. 

The stuff you buy from dealers or online whatever is absolute junk - I wouldn’t waste my time with it. 

I have tried Diazepam, Zopiclone, Zolpidem, Promethazine, even Propranolol, and Lorazepam but these literally don’t do anything. 

Codeine is the closest I can get for some reason to help me sleep, cocodamol to be specific. 

I think I was perhaps overstimulated from a late night gym session - but nonetheless thank you for your sound advice."
8066,h8mlyqk,,,insomnia,1628752238,"I get irritable as well. I get out of bed and pace around my living room a bit. Sometimes I get very overwhelmed with not sleeping and I go on here which helps me oddly. If it’s really bad, I’ll wake someone up in my house to vent to."
8067,h8mlrcj,,,insomnia,1628752065,"I've had 3 hours sleep p/night for a good long while now, more than 5 days for sure, tonight has had no sleep for me.

You have no reason to go to the ER if this is your only symptom, some folks wouldn't even count that as insomnia proper. This in no way constitutes a medical emergency."
8068,h8mlq43,,,insomnia,1628752036,"So I've been using benzo's for sleep for around 15 years - the trick is to set a limit of once or twice a week (start with once and see how you go after 6 months). It's a great crutch to help you cope, but it's not a cure for insomnia. If you take daily, it'll be great for a month or so, then you'll start developing a tolerance and either you take more or it stops working. Then you get dependant too, and you can't just stop taking them, and the withdrawals are both fucking awful and deadly so you have to taper off for a while, and you'll have insomnia that whole time as well. They give me one or two good nights a week, and that's enough that I can function well. I'm afraid of taking more as I really don't want them to stop working. Temazepam or Xanax will be what you want. Low dose (5-10mg T, 0.25-0.5mg X) will still help you drift off, but you won't feel like shit the next day as they've got shorter half-lives than diazepam.

Oh, and definitely try doxylamine succinate - cheap and effective. Doesn't stop you waking up early, but helps you drift back to sleep and you can get a really good sleep in. I've been using that for nearly 25 years. Not great for during the week as if you only sleep for 8 hrs you feel a bit groggy for the first few hours, not ideal for work. Great for a weekend catchup sleep though to stop the insomnia from taking over. Also, melatonin is your friend, but higher doses don't always work better. Makes a 4-5 hr sleep feel like you've have 6-7 as it takes you deeper - useful if you're a light sleeper, but not magic either."
8069,h8mlm6n,,,insomnia,1628751946,I’m in the same boat currently. I slept for about an hour then woke up and am now restless and irritable. I’m so sleepy but can’t fall back asleep. It’s terrible. I hope we both can get some sleep soon.
8070,h8mkoqc,,,insomnia,1628751191,As someone trying to get off benzos. Please don't go there. Ask for clonidine and with doxylamine as well. You'll sleep like a baby :)

8083,h8m97fm,,,insomnia,1628743136,Antidepressants can cause insomnia and sleep disturbances going on and going off the drug.  The mechanisms of action on the 5HT2C receptors are linked to chronic fatigue syndrome and insomnia.  Antidepressants prohibit REM sleep and deep sleep needed for brain and muscle recovery.   The ER probably won’t help much as you already have benzodiazepines for anxiety and sleep.  Your prescriber may be able to call in a prescription for Trazodone if it is available in your country.  It is an antidepressant prescribed off label for sleep in low 25-50mg doses as it has sedating effects.  Antidepressants causing insomnia is listed in the manufacturer’s literature.

8087,h8m6xdg,,,insomnia,1628741785,"You’re doctor is the best to advise on this, it seems you have maintenance insomnia, you made a few points in your posts like not prioritizing sleep, life was a bit less demanding, flexibility isn’t an option and now demands in your job are taking a toll.  With seeing a doctor the end goal is finding something that’ll keep you asleep, not what you want to hear I’m sure.  

In the meantime, Limit your total time in bed. Spending excessive amounts of time in bed can lead to both onset and maintenance insomnia issues.  If your spending too much time in bed ‘trying to sleep’, restricting time in bed may help in consolidating sleep. 

You probably get anxiety centered around your sleep, this is something to consider, like waking and getting frustrated, anxious about how your day isn’t going go the way you want or need it to, this all compounds your sleep even more.  Just a few points to consider."
8088,h8m63mp,,,insomnia,1628741305,"seconding this! judging by OP's post history, i think anxiety amd overthinking things are playing a big role- just wanted to add some advice that (sometimes) works for my insomnia/anxiety flares:

listening to certain sounds like storms and ticking clocks are a big help most nights. temperature wise, try a lighter blanket if air conditioning/fans etc aren't an option, and try to do the one foot in one foot out method. sounds dumb but it makes a difference!

also putting away your phone, tablet, computer, or turning on a screen filter that blocks blue light when spending time on a screen around bedtime is a pretty big first step. i mean, we're insomniacs on reddit, so at the very least i do suggest the screen filter, if browsing is something that helps take your mind off things! good luck OP, hope something helps~"

At a min, you’re getting core slerp, this isn’t an emergency.  Perhaps your doc can advise on your taper, etc, maybe give you something else to help with the withdrawing process and sleep and anxiety."

8099,h8m0f7v,,,insomnia,1628733224,Sleep studies are used to diagnose a variety of sleep disorders. And catching sleep apnea early is important as it can reduce the increased risk of other diseases by using proper treatment.

8102,h8m03wb,,,insomnia,1628733063,"Your ""normal state"" is with you all the time. The you that is funny and joyful, the you that is irritated and stressed, it's all the same person. You can integrate them. The best version of you is inside you all the time. Telling yourself that you can't come down in your current situation is reality because you are telling yourself that and you believe it. 

I don't know what will work for you but this is what worked for me. I rescheduled/paused some of my commitments to give me more time. I started meditating 10 minutes a day with an app that helped me so much (Waking up by Sam Harris), started exercising about 30 minutes a day, cut back on unhealthy foods and alcohol, but mostly I started examining my thoughts very carefully. Especially negative ones, I would write them down and really consider where they were coming from, and noticing how illogical they were. Nowadays, when I have a negative reaction to anything, any negative emotion, I can work through it quickly. 

I must admit this ability came after a few years of pretty serious trauma. I became so miserable that if I didn't find a new way to live and if I couldn't control the quality of my thinking, I was going to lose everything."

8105,h8lyvmt,,,insomnia,1628732469,"I worked overnights for ten years. It really messed up my circadian rhythm that to this day (4 years later), I still have gnarly insomnia. When I was on overnights, I would create a strict rule to not have any caffeine after a certain time. I worked until 6am, and tried to be asleep by 10am. So after 3am I had no more coffee, or soda. For the most part it worked. That and YouTube binges

It’s likely this is a temporary issue that will right itself. Avoid caffeine and screens and don’t try to nap during the day. Your anxiety will be contributing to the situation so just be calm and accept that most people have temporary problems with sleep in their lifetime. This will eventually pass and you will be fine."
8108,h8lyaal,,,insomnia,1628732192,I have been going through the same thing but for me it’s been almost 2 weeks of light sleep. Im scared of fatal insomnia too.

I think worst for me have been the 3-4 night benders with only an hour or two of sleep average each night, maybe. And then had that going on for a few months. That was not so fun, but I don't think I'd make it through 7 days of zero -- I didn't even realize that was possible and not mortal."

8120,h8lue4a,,,insomnia,1628730358,"Let me preface this with a very strong: **I am** ***not*** **a doctor!**

For many years I used half a 25mg pill, and it worked fine. I have been using 25mg for a while now, but have actually been thinking of seeing how half of one is working for me these days. If you have experienced side effects that you are not comfortable with, that is something to be very mindful of. I don't think I've noticed such a thing in many years. Ambien, Lunesta, and one or two others, I've tried -- no thank you.

I try to take the Seroquel 30-45 mins before getting into bed. Seems to be hitting me then -- but for me, the effect is very subtle. But hey, it seems to flip a switch! I'm male, early 40s, about 156 pounds atm.

Hasn't been a cure-all. I have Zolpidem on-hand which I use a few times a month. If something is going on in my life that needs to be addressed and I am not addressing it, and a level of (even subtle) anxiety has ramped up, I can get into a bender of awful sleep, beyond being helped by meds."
8121,h8ltp5f,,,insomnia,1628730027,That sounds like a spiritual issue -- I highly suggest finding enlightenment! :)
8122,h8ltam3,,,insomnia,1628729837,"Just a question, why would you go to the ER vs going to your doctor? Do you have a GP?

You're not anywhere close to dying from insomnia territory -- not saying it's a good thing *at all,* but there's a lot of people who only get 4-5 hours of sleep a night. If you're not used to it, it's a bitch, but hardly life-threatening territory for most people in any immediate sense.

Do you consume caffeine? I have to avoid it after noon, especially coffee or tea. It can help get me through the rough mornings, but if I have it after about noon, it will totally mess up my whole sleep cycle that night.

Having had chronic insomnia for many years (probably 17 or so now), and some *very* rough periods including end of last year and earlier this year, I can say I've never gone to the ER. I have a sleep doctor and a supportive GP. Going to the ER probably crossed my mind a few times in the early days (I'm early 40s now, and this started to come on more in my late 20s/early 30s). For me it was better to get armed with the right set of tools and routines and resources, so I wouldn't have to get to the point of going to the ER."
8123,h8lt309,,,insomnia,1628729738,"Maybe try smoking or eating some herb or drinking herbal tea before bed, maybe a boring movie or documentary while you go to sleep  to calm your mind ?  The more you over think about  sleeping the more you will get frustrated about not sleeping because you are keeping your mind active thinking about it if that makes sense."
8124,h8lst54,,,insomnia,1628729606,Have you tried melatonin? 4-5 hours a night can be draining but it's not life threatening. ER will probably give you bennydryl which you can just get at the pharmacy. Good luck!
8125,h8lsg5c,,,insomnia,1628729437,"As an insomniac for over a decade now, I was a little upset at first that you are panicking and wanting to waste the E.R.'s valuable time over only sleeping 5hrs a night 5 nights in a row when there are weeks I don't sleep at all 5 nights in a row due to actual insomnia for YEARS and would kill for 5 hrs for 1 night in a row some weeks and there are people out there much worse than I am so be careful calling 5 hrs of sleep a night for 5 nights insomnia... especially when it's the first time.. we're tired and frustrated 😂... With that said...No, you should not go to the ER for only sleeping 5 hrs 5 nights in a row...it's not an emergency. If you truly are bothered or worried it may be the beginning of insomnia then make an appointment with your general Dr and get a referral for a sleep specialist."

8131,h8lrm50,,,insomnia,1628729044,"I've been on low-dose Seroquel (quetiapine fumarate) for many years now, and for me it has been a game-changer. Some doctors swear by it, others are more hesitant (although much less so today, vs. \~15 years ago when I began using it). It's non-habit-forming. It's an anti-psychotic, but quite commonly prescribed at much lower doses ""off-label"" for sleeping. I've never, I don't think, had a nasty side effect. At times I've gone up to 50mg, but if it's not working it's kind of not working, I find (something else is going on in my life that is causing me increased anxiety). For those rarer occurrences I have a Zolpidem prescription (it's in the same family as Ambien), and I use it sparingly, maybe a couple or so times a month.

I toss this out there not to say it's the path for you, but there's plenty to talk to a doctor about, in any case, and there *are* paths that can help. Don't lose hope!"
8132,h8lox1w,,,insomnia,1628727785,I try that but it doesn't work. My mind starts to notice the counting and I think of math homework
8133,h8loqo2,,,insomnia,1628727701,"No problem! It sounds like you have a good roadmap for pursuing lifestyle changes, if you choose to, that may well end up being very helpful to you in many ways. Try stopping the caffeine at noon, try to get in at least a 30-minute walk every day and stand up for a minute or two every hour during the day. Watch your diet, try to engage socially a bit, in comfortable environments and with closer friends. The transition period won't be trivial, but it may pay off in spades."
8134,h8loop8,,,insomnia,1628727676,"Yeah, good advice. I should follow that advice, though I don’t feel like paying for it.

Thanks for your response."
8135,h8lnx91,,,insomnia,1628727320,"Thanks for your huge message

About the fact WE all share this pb, i think it has more influence on my wellness than on most people since i almost stopped doing things for myself (going out, talking to my close ones, i will never plan something with my friend but just sometimes join them for something they planned)

I drink lots of coffees cause otherwise i cant hold my days (never drink it After 4pm though) but maybe i should stop earlier (noon as you said)


I almost never excercise cause i feel exhausted whenever i end my shift and can't manage to go out afterward. I did run a bit today though because i felt i neeeded to vent physically, felt good but tiring at the same Time

I have tried those sleep routines but i find them barely reliable cuz sometimes even when i go go bed early i manage to get huge insomnia (4-5 jours before managing to sleep)


I'll try again though since you look like you know it helps on a longer terme

Thanks again mate"
8136,h8lnc1z,,,insomnia,1628727037,"I take about 400mg about an hour before bedtime. I take 1000mg of ashwagandha and 3mg of melatonin. Together they work really well.

8138,h8lm99m,,,insomnia,1628726532,"Consider talking to a sleep specialist who is experienced with insomnia (not just one who deals with sleep apnea). Sleep hygiene is worth paying attention to, but for some of us, it's not enough. I've heard good things about CBTi (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) and will probably give it a shot myself at some point."
8139,h8lm1do,,,insomnia,1628726428,"The first thing to be aware of is that *a lot* of the people in our global society suffer from chronic anxiety, and it's quite endemic in this era. We did not biologically evolve to live with things like electric light, much less the internet, smartphones, etc. The reason I point this out, is because it may be actually liberating for you to recognize how common what you're experiencing is. You may feel none of your friends would get it, but you yourself said you bottle most of this up -- chances are, you know people in your day to day life who are doing exactly the same. On some level, we are *all* doing it, some with more success than others. It's probably a sign of intelligence that you're not able to ""let go"" of things as easily as others. A mentally-active brain is not always an ally when trying to unwind and find sleepiness. Consider opening up to some of the people you feel genuinely closest to -- family, friends, mentor. You don't have to lay it all on them at once, but having people you can relate these things to is helpful.

There's a lot of other advice that may be useful, but I would try to focus on a few things you might be able to control somewhat easily, that can at least tip things in a more positive direction. Can you get yourself to go to bed an hour earlier, over time? Do you consume caffeine after noon? I can't personally have almost any caffeine, especially caffeinated beverages, after noon, or I will find it almost impossible to sleep that night. Do you have a decent ""sleep hygiene"" routine (you can Google it for some tips)? See if you can nudge a few things in a more productive direction, see if it helps. Do you exercise regularly? It's important, as we all know -- but all too easy to leave out of our daily routine, in our fast-paced lives."

8149,h8lgjo8,,,insomnia,1628723874,"I myself tried trazadone but could not stand the hangover. Then after 2 years was switched to estazolam (a benzo), and that did work for me after switching to a forced schedule (2 weeks on med). To be honest mine fell into place after 2 weeks on this medication and being on a strict schedule. I would go to bed at 10/11pm every night regardless and wake up at 5/6am with no acceptations for lack of sleep. I do not take this medication any longer besides when I am absolutely sure my anxiety will keep me awake; I maybe take it 1-2 times a month. So I have had trouble after discontinuing the benzo but I just try to get back into an early morning wakeup so eventually my mind is too spun to think by bedtime. If you have a benzo abuse problem I would honestly try a strict schedule for 2 weeks, I've been struggling with insomnia since 15y/o, I am now 21; this has really worked for me even after discontinuation of medication.

I thought I had it because I’d have multiple nights in a row where it felt I could not reach REM. With fatal insomnia a person falls asleep but never reaches REM. It is caused by prions, like mad cow disease. Can get it through eating diseased meat, but yeah still extremely rare.  Anyway, I definitely do not have it and either does anyone in this group. I have been sleeping great lately.  we all suffer from anxiety and mental chatter that has to do with living in a fucked up society driven by capitalism. please try to meditate, cut out gluten from the diet, get sunlight and exercise each day, eat organic food as much as possible, stop drinking alcohol."

It sounds like you've been managing it well but it returned. As long as it doesn't hang around long you should be okay.

8196,h8kulw2,,,insomnia,1628714494,"Medical marijuana is divided into 3 types. Sativa buds tend to give energy, or bring you ""up."" Indicas are good for making you sleepy. Then there are hybrids, which is a blend of both. If your doctor prescribes you mm for insomnia, they'll point you to indicas to help you sleep. 

It's actually amazing what genetic engineering has done for mm. They make buds to increase appetite, to address anxiety, to ease pain. Dispensaries have specific buds for a wide variety of issues and you can pick what works best for your issues."

8198,h8kt3q6,,,insomnia,1628713856,"I really recommend not relying on them, but as a *temporary* tool when you run out of your meds, the over-the-counter sleep aids can help.

And don't be too worried, I've gone *days* (three) without more than 1-2 hours of sleep per night. It's ***awful*** and I very much ***don't*** recommend it, but if I can make it through that and still be here somewhat intact (ha), you WILL make it through this spell!"
8199,h8ksyso,,,insomnia,1628713798,"Are you taking benzos *for* insomnia, or for another condition and it happens to help with your insomnia? I would personally (as in, for me) be wary of taking a benzo daily specifically for insomnia. It might be worth talking with your doc about alternatives? 

Seroquel has been a life-saver for me, 25mg/night (or less, and very rarely a tad more) does the trick maybe 80-90% of the time. Non-habit-forming (non-addictive, not a narcotic). Suuuure, technically it's an anti-psychotic, but it's become a very common thing to prescribe at micro-doses specifically for insomnia (I'm sure the fact that it makes me slightly less insane is also a good thing). ;)"

8202,h8krfq1,,,insomnia,1628713146,"Ugh, getting stimulated from the phone, both the light and mental activity, are probably *not* going to help wind you down. Meditating at 3-4am is ideal! A very creative window. Try writing -- pencil or pen and paper, not screen.

Also might be worth Googling ""second sleep."" A lot of people have no idea what this is. Turns out, there's a ton of evidence that the natural human sleep cycle is actually two periods, separated by an hour or so at roughly 3-4am. So maybe 4-5 hours of sleep, then another 2-4 hours, roughly. Our modern lifestyle of electric lighting, computers, interwebs, TV, typical work shifts, etc. has led to us abandoning the 2-period sleep cycle, to the point where we've actually forgotten as a species that it existed, and is what millions of years of evolution led us to -- we can't just abandon it in a cosmic blink of an eye."
8203,h8kqnew,,,insomnia,1628712811,"Force yourself to try to pee, even if it doesn't feel like you need to at all. May or may not be the trick for you, but for me it was instrumental. When I wake up (same timeframe) I now force myself to get conscious enough to get out of bed and go to the bathroom. I always end up peeing, even when it wasn't obvious I needed to. I used to roll around for hours trying to get back to sleep, and not being able to get comfortable ""for some reason."" I guess I'm just not as plugged-in to my body at that point of the night, so I really had to teach myself to even recognize that I was becoming conscious, and to FREAKING PEE! no matter what. It sounds silly, I know, but again, it has made a HUGE difference to me. I still deal with insomnia, but it's much less bad now. Good luck, you got this. :) 

Oh, and if you drink booze at night, keep in mind that your body can get into a stimulated mode when you finish metabolizing the booze, and it can absolutely wake you up. Being more limited in my evening drinking (and drinking in general) has also helped me a lot."

You’ve been writing about renovations to your home and your door change for weeks.  Its not the renovations or your door, it’s your reaction, something is triggering your anxiety and at this juncture compulsiveness.  

You should do something to help your self and your comfort. Leave the door open, close off part of the vent in your room, crack a window, use a fan, sleep where you are taking naps if this is more comfortable.  perhaps if that old door hadn’t been hauled off yet, put it back on."

8230,h8k6alo,,,insomnia,1628704470,"When I used to go to sleep at 6am every morning and wake up well into the day I used to have a nightmare just about every night, never a normal dream it always had some sinister overtones to it, I just think that during the day we're hearing more sounds from people busy outside, neighbours other people in your place of residence etc so you're picking it all up while asleep and it's causing extensive dreaming, why it's always nightmares I don't know though."
8231,h8k5zee,,,insomnia,1628704340,Cortisol levels are typically highest in early morning and it's normal for somebody  with anxiety/depression to be more sensitive to cortisol to begin with so this is why people with an anxiety disorder will often wake up in the early morning with anxiety that seemingly comes from nowhere.
8232,h8k2z5l,,,insomnia,1628703021,Agree completely! I make sure to exercise daytime. To have plenty of wind down time til sleep. And no it definitely don't have to be intense. A regular walk works great if people don't have time / motivation to do more. That's how I started. Two years of walks. Trying to walk several times per week.

8246,h8jpxia,,,insomnia,1628697484,Generally if your body is releasing melatonin your heart rate should lower as it gets ready for sleep. Your heart rate abnormalities might be from other things.
8247,h8jpslj,,,insomnia,1628697429,I agree with this. I have had some of the best sleep I have had in years this past week by exercising. The key is also not letting yourself get so revved up that you don't wind down before bed. It doesn't have to be super intense either. I use to do way too high intensity and it hurt more than it helped.

When do you normally get up in the morning?"
8264,h8jihi1,,,insomnia,1628694366,"It's like jet lag. The key to shifting your circadian rhythm is to get up in the morning at a consistent time, and get enough bright light exposure from the sun (or SAD lamp) then and in the daytime. Don't bother going to bed ""early"", you won't have enough sleep pressure. It takes a few days to shift, but treat it exactly like flying to the other side of the world: you have to get up when it's light out."

You shouldn't be combining Benzo's and opioids.

Best advice see a proper doctor as nitrazepam, diazepam, Temazepam and Zopiclone/Zolpidem all much better than Xanax and codeine."

The only way I can sometimes sleep on schedule is to take my medications everyday at the same time and going to bed as soon it kicks in without any device around me.

Life is a series of cycles. Before this 2-3 year cycle, I had the most fulfilling and wonderful 5 years ever. I used to use drugs to cope, my household was abusive and I could never tell the Pysch the truth when I was put into Pysch hospitals, but once I moved out I had 10 full years of happiness.

That seems to be the initial cause of your insomniac experiences, but what has truly transformed it into insomnia is your restlessness and anxiety when waking up early. As he has conditioned you to wake up earlier, you have conditioned yourself to feeling angry about waking up early.

I would recommend having a conversation with him about this, respectfully of course. I'm trying to imagine a scenario where a loud door couldn't be silenced if someone is just well... cautious?

If they really can't do anything about it, I would recommend sleeping earplugs as the other guy suggested. They are pretty effective. If you leave your sleep like this, your insomnia could unfortunately worsen.

THIS! It’s exactly how I’ve been feeling. Although mine isn’t because of cancer and I’m so sorry you’ve experienced this but I’m so glad you’re here to talk about it. You would think a doctor would be like “woah, with your medical history that we’ve retrieved this year alone, we should definitely check this out!”. I go to a clinic so they’re all swamped and just want one person out of their room and another one in there. I messaged my surgeon who performed the surgery tonight (at like 1230am) telling her everything and that the dr office I’m at hasn’t been able to put two and two together and literally begged her to help me. I hope she responds because she isn’t a “clinic” doctor. 

I’ve been taking melatonin with my trazodone at night in hopes that I can sleep but they’re both garbage and I’ve been meaning to get to the store to buy magnesium, but when I leave work I go straight to a department store to get more “work fitting” clothes instead. I just started a new good paying job.

I took two tonight to sleep since I didn’t sleep a wink last night and had 3 hours the night before (I typically take one per night plus melatonin). 

It’s now 1am and I’m wide awake and crying. I just got a new and really good job that I started this past Monday.

I know I have to have my thyroid re-checked after my recent bloodwork because the thyroid levels didn’t make sense to them and they thought the results deemed sub clinical. I know they never checked my hormone levels. Since hindsight is 20/20, I’m shocked they didn’t check them dat my last blood panel considering I came in for a physical because I’m now being seen by their psych and had an oophorectomy this year.

I've always had some mild insomnia but it suddenly got really really bad after my hysterectomy with BSO. It was like my brain totally forgot how to sleep. Sleep meds stopped working after a week. Hot flashes weren't that severe but the insomnia was absolutely brutal. 3 hours of sleep was a good day.  
I wasn't able to take hormones (my hysterectomy was for cancer) so I google researched supplements that were beneficial for insomnia and menopause. I take a multivitamin, magnesium, and pycnogenol now. I think the magnesium was the game-changer. Now I can sleep pretty well if the room is not hot.

8365,h8homw4,,,insomnia,1628650584,"Melatonin isn’t something that even has “extended” release usefulness in the body.  Waste of money.  More than a 1mg dose is wasted as well.  Melatonin is a hormone that is released by the body based on the amount of daylight hitting your optic nerve.  It then triggers the release of neurotransmitters that signal to the body it’s time to switch into sleep/ recovery mode.  It cannot make you fall asleep no matter how much you take.  Your body can only use a very small amount.  If you already make that amount, taking more just tells your body to stop making it.  Which can mess things up later.

As far as why the codeine and Xanax combo didn’t make you sleepy I’d say it’s bc you’re accustomed to these chemicals.  Neither are sleep agents.  It’s also really not good to take two central nervous system depressant chemicals together.

I’m sorry you’re awake.  Insomnia fucking sucks.  Talk to your GP about actual sleep medication.   There are many to choose from."
8366,h8ho33f,,,insomnia,1628650294,"Then I definitely recommend blue lotus, valerian root, and passionflower. I use them with lemon balm, lavender, and rose petals for a sleep tea that has minimal aftereffects"

8375,h8hewfo,,,insomnia,1628645673,"Try a black **silk** eye mask from another brand. If it was that uncomfortable, it was likely a bad quality eye mask. Normally it should feel very very smooth, light and comfortable to wear."
8376,h8hekbj,,,insomnia,1628645507,"Why suggest a behavioral association when it's perfectly well established that a basic sleep fact is that melatonin is inhibited by bright light exposure of the eyes, even when closed, and that using an eyes mask will most likely fully block this light and hence preserve the natural melatonin secretion?

Of course eyes masks are necessary for people with sleep disorders. This has nothing to do with behavioral association and everything to do with maintaining a healthy endogenous secretion of melatonin. Melatonin is necessary for a non-fragmented sleep."

8379,h8h6n6p,,,insomnia,1628641585,Sometimes it just doesn’t affect people as strongly. Or the weed was shit 😂 but CBD is also a great option. The one friend that didn’t feel anything from weed felt more relaxed and effected from CBD gummies and she liked them better.
8380,h8h6ak1,,,insomnia,1628641414,Thanks for coming back to me. It was a bong and a joint. I tried it a few times maybe 3-4 in total but no sauce. I think you are right I will try CBT
8381,h8h63vg,,,insomnia,1628641322,"Did you just try it the one time? And what method? I don’t mean to be pushy but my friend also said she didn’t feel anything really the first time she tried it, but after a few more times and trying a different method it can start to work better. - but I get it with the prescription drugs, I’ve tried so many but nothing has worked as well for me as well as weed. I don’t have much else advice other than some good old fashioned therapy. Hope you can find something that does work for you"
8382,h8h5s6w,,,insomnia,1628641163,eye mask is a lifesaver.
8383,h8h4d8d,,,insomnia,1628640461,Yeh honestly I have tried it. I’m not big into drugs but I have friends who are big pro weed people. The recommended it and I did give it a try but yeh didn’t do anything for me unfortunately. I sort of wish it had because it’s probably a lot less problematic compared to some of the prescription drugs out there.
8384,h8h3e0s,,,insomnia,1628639985,"It might not be the most popular opinion, and I can’t guarantee any effects since we are all different, but marijuana has helped a lot with my insomnia."
8385,h8gzux3,,,insomnia,1628638254,"No problem at all. I know we can be at our worse when we’re sleepy. And if you’re like me, I sometimes feel like I need to resolve these things ASAP before I could go to sleep but I found it was always better to let that go, and worry about it when I woke. Not going to resolve anything that late at night anyways lol."
8386,h8gzl2g,,,insomnia,1628638122,"That’s good advice, thank you 😊"
8387,h8gzj40,,,insomnia,1628638096,Perhaps save that conversation for the morning? I know when me and my boyfriend tried to communicate these issues in the middle of the night they never turned out well lol. You don’t have to have a solution right now. Just try and relax and keep those worries for tomorrow.
8388,h8gz1w2,,,insomnia,1628637869,Just worried about going back in the bedroom with my boyfriend in there. I just tried to talk to him about how I feel and he was just basically saying I’m being dramatic and then just didn’t respond.
8389,h8gywqi,,,insomnia,1628637801,"Don’t feel bad, nothing more annoying than wanting to sleep so bad but you can’t. Just take a few deep breaths, try taking a stronger dose (as long as it’s only temporary) and remember this is NOT permanent."
8390,h8gypa4,,,insomnia,1628637702,Yer probably a good idea. Sorry annoying because tonight I was drifting off and then I woke up and now I feel horrific
8391,h8gyl7w,,,insomnia,1628637648,Exact same. You could try taking a higher dose maybe?
8392,h8gybwm,,,insomnia,1628637528,I just panic that it’s not going to work and then guess what….it doesn’t  !
8393,h8gyath,,,insomnia,1628637514,I got one last week after having spells for the past 2 months of not being able to sleep for 4 or even 5 days in a row - It's honestly a live saver!
8394,h8gy8e6,,,insomnia,1628637482,My body has been doing this recently too... it’s awful 😞
8395,h8gxuns,,,insomnia,1628637301,I’ve tried zoplidem (ambien) but my body just fights it
8396,h8gxrie,,,insomnia,1628637259,If it’s only a temporary situation I’d recommend some sleeping meds. Try going to a walk in clinic or even something over the counter.

8398,h8gxhn7,,,insomnia,1628637130,Try sleeping somewhere else. One of the best decisions I’ve ever made for my relationship is sleeping in different beds. We both agreed we would never sleep in the same bed again lol
8399,h8gwoxc,,,insomnia,1628636754,Yup! I've had my insomnia and anxiety under control for 7 years and then I took amoxicillin and have been having insomnia and anxiety with a tense and aching stomach. From what I've read it will run it's course and you'll be back to normal. Just a waiting game...
8400,h8gtg6o,,,insomnia,1628635242,"Tried one. It disturbed me, rather than helped. It was uncomfortable, and hot.

I have occasionally used earplugs, when neighbors are being a-holes. The gel or foam ones are pretty soft, and not too bothersome. Better than noise. I only use them for a couple of hours, before I take them out (when the a-holes STFU)."
8401,h8gt2nv,,,insomnia,1628635066,They all stop working for me. Even trazodone and quetiapine. Maybe exercise is the only thing that may help forever
8402,h8gqhlp,,,insomnia,1628633853,I do this too after I lost my eye mask lol. Too lazy to buy another one.

8405,h8glumr,,,insomnia,1628631768,"Eye mask, earplugs, and white noise machine, in order of importance. But all 3 are essential. I've been sleeping with these 3 items for over 10 years. Sometimes I take naps without them but I can't imagine living without these 3 items."
8406,h8gjx9n,,,insomnia,1628630918,You really should try a legit eye mask. I used to do this too while traveling and masks are substantially better.
8407,h8gjtal,,,insomnia,1628630869,I use one that’s like filled with little beads and conforms to my face. I don’t see any light with mine.
8408,h8giykc,,,insomnia,1628630491,"I’ve also been able to do my job without too much trouble too. Though, it’s a physical job so while it is tiring, I don’t find myself about to collapse or whatever it would feel like without any sleep at all.

Idk, I feel like tonight will go better but I do wonder if it’ll be a similar night like last night. I didn’t do anything wrong last night but still couldn’t sleep."

If nothing works, I literally dunno what to do with my mental health and my family doesn't make it any better and are not supportive. Wish me luck today!"
8415,h8ge4gc,,,insomnia,1628628380,Not great but glad to know your feeling good rn  but thats something you may wanna keep an eye out
8416,h8g9j3f,,,insomnia,1628626424,I have taken 100-200mg quetiapine daily at bedtime for about 4 years. It helps me sleep really good and I haven't had any side effects.
8417,h8g8lq1,,,insomnia,1628626027,I use an eye mask that is connected via Bluetooth to my phone. If I’m having trouble sleeping (or staying asleep) I’ll turn on the sleep machine app and listen to wave sounds or white noise. It’s made all the difference.
8418,h8g88v5,,,insomnia,1628625876,I use a folded black tshirt instead of an eye mask because this way it fully covers my eyes and I can mold it around my nose so no light gets in and it also covers my ears. It was a game changer for me. Now I can't sleep without it

8424,h8g6cwa,,,insomnia,1628625063,"It’s funny bc the exact opposite is what works best for me. I guess everyone is a little different.

I focus now on getting sleep when I can. If I’m tired enough to fall asleep during the day, then I do, because I am getting sleep whenever I can. I also focus less on the need to sleep at night only, because my whole life sleeping on a schedule at nighttime has never worked. Once I got that concept out of my mind, and just sleep when my body tells me to, I get more sleep than I ever did."
8425,h8g693o,,,insomnia,1628625018,"It’s possible cuz sometimes i think i’m awake, 5 minutes later i look my phone but it’s 2h later !"

To me, it feels a bit odd sleeping with something touching my eyes, but it’s my first couple of days, so I think I’m just getting used to it. And also with mine, I can slightly see outside through the bottom of the mask. Is mine too loose or is this normal with masks? Anyways, I agree it’s been a game-changer especially for meditating going to sleep, and for the mornings. I highly suggest trying one with Bluetooth functionality for anyone who’s considering it. Great post"
8427,h8g375t,,,insomnia,1628623709,Yes!! I’ve been using an eye mask for the last three years and it’s been a total game changer for my sleep.

You're right about an easier time tonight, as your homeostatic sleep drive should be ramped up.

Sometimes sleep issues can be somewhat cyclical, and having rough patches now and then isn't at all unusual.  Key is to stay with your normal routine that works, know you'll be OK even if doesn't feel like you slept all that well, and stay positive.  Worry about sleep fuels the problem.

If you have no unaddressed med issues, then you might consider using a full CBT sleep training system, which will give you a comprehensive structure for permanent improvement."

Good luck.  Insomnia is absolute misery.  People need food, water, and sleep.  To deprive ourselves of a basic necessity like this is very difficult."

Yes, a z-drug (Lunesta, Ambien, zopiclone, etc.) is a far better sleep med than trazadone. They usually start you out on trazadone because it's non-addictive and isn't easily abused. 

The risk with z-drugs is you could become dependent on them. However, IMO, that's far better than putting up with chronic insomnia."
8464,h8esx5f,,,insomnia,1628604045,"As I said, focus on reducing negative influences than maximising positive influences. Start with your mental problems first. Have hope! Live life to your own rules and at your own pace, find inner peace in your insomnia.

Go take a hot shower and think to yourself. Your exams that gave you insomnia is gonna ruin the rest of your life? You're gonna die early? You're probably gonna die to a disease because of your poor immune system? You feel weak, you're gonna develop a coronary condition, you don't believe in a good future?

What the fuck, hell no! You think a stupid exam is gonna change the rest of your life? Well if so, then god is a sadist and life is fucking stupid anyway. FIND PEACE IN YOUR INSOMNIA. THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. Work your way towards fixing it.

The first step is hope. Mock and understand the ridiculousness of insomnia. Find peace in the silent hours of the night. Have hope!

Also, I can tell you probably didn't read any of my comment. If you neglect help from others and wallow in your own self-hatred and pity, how will you ever improve? Open up from yourself first before seeking othres."

But I promise you that unless it's holidays and life is chill for a moment, insomnia of that degree probably won't just magically disappear. The first step is to accept the insomnia and kind of stop caring about it. Never get angry at yourself for the insomnia, or want to stop living.

If none of the medicine you try work, perhaps it's better to try and not use any medicine at all. Do you have any beliefs as to what mainly started the insomnia? You say it's because of your exam but is that because of stress? Because your sleep schedule got ruined and you couldn't fix it again? Because you simply forgot how to sleep due to trying to stay up all the time?

Not gonna lie, this is on the more severe side of insomnia stories I've read. But I've seen and experienced worse, and seen people including myself who have mainly recovered from it. The insomnia didn't really magically disappear, we worked towards it. So trust me, please don't give up.

Misplaced hope is bad but giving up is worse. Just live life at your own pace and try not to care as much about your sleep and insomnia issues. Look into sleep hygiene and understand your thought patterns and how your body feels. This subreddit has so many similar stories that people frequently share their experiences with, you're bound to find at least one thing that can help.

I'd like to give advice but I'm a bit tired. But from my experience and from reading hundreds of insomnia experiences, this is what I believe works best for severe insomnia:

Stop caring about insomnia &gt; Understanding thought patterns &gt; sleep restriction &gt; association to bed with sleep &gt; blue light exposure (and getting our during daylight) &gt; regulating circadian rhythm &gt; exercise 3+ hours before bed &gt; leaving bed if you can't sleep &gt; sleep hygiene/

The more you read and experiment with your own insomnia, the more you will understand these terms and master your mind. Something to note is that in regards to insomnia, **MINIMISING NEGATIVE INFLUENCES &gt; MAXIMISING POSITIVE INFLUENCES.**

In other words, reducing stress is more important than bright screen lights imo. If you've established an association to your bed with being alert and awake, fixing that is more important than meditating to ease that alertness."

8477,h8eig1r,,,insomnia,1628598631,"Honestly, you have to try, try, try, try to not fall asleep in the day. It's the only thing that's ever worked for me to reset my body clock. Sometimes this has meant I'm awake for 3 days straight. Then sleep my usual 8/9 hours and then get up at my usual time. No naps. No caffeine. No alcohol or drugs. A small walk and light, healthy meals. Even at weekends. Even when I'm so exhausted I could be sick. Even when all I want to do is knock a valium and sleep for 20 hours. Bed at 10, up at 7. Rinse and repeat for as long as it takes.

(For some people broken sleep 4/awake/4 for example works better. This could be something to look into once you've got some rhythm back.)

It's a painful process but nothing else I've ever tried has worked to sort out my sleep schedule. I've had terrible sleep my whole life, but it's SO much better now. Good luck, you can do it and this is temporary."

8479,h8ei66b,,,insomnia,1628598470,"If they've quadrupled it and it still isn't working, they definitely need to try something new. I usually get my sleeping meds dosage upped once, and if that doesnt work, they put me on a new one. I'm currently on my 9th different sleeping med to try out, so don't feel discouraged if you feel like you're getting ran through the ringer on meds. It's definitely a shitty game, but you have to keep playing.

Don't give up. Do what you can to make yourself comfortable. If you need to take a day or two off work (and can afford to), don't feel bad to do so. Sometime you just need that extra recharge"

8487,h8e8t6s,,,insomnia,1628591976,"It sounds like you might have a sleeping disorder just from what you've said. What all have you tried to help you sleep? Based on the fact that you said you can sleep better on the weekends, it might be stress induced."
8488,h8e8nnj,,,insomnia,1628591854,"I'm not a doctor, have no medical experience, but I have super high tolerance for medications and have to take a bunch of different kinds just to get any sleep. (I say this to let you know I'm not reliable as a source). When I try things like what you're suggesting I do it in a very VERY small dose just in case it has any adverse affects, or if it doesn't react well together. But in my experience, melatonin is a pretty, and I say this with no knowledge of it scientifically, weak drug. I'd suggest trying it, but only if you're super comfortable doing it, and just to be super safe, let someone else know."
8489,h8e5xdy,,,insomnia,1628589599,"First, accept that you’re going to be awake for awhile after lying down. Be OK with it, like you know you aren’t going to be falling asleep anytime soon, it’s all good you’ll fall asleep and get some sleep OK with it.

Turn off the lights once you’re lying down. If having a fan on doesn’t bother you point one in your general direction, towards your face if you can. 

Key thing: put something on YouTube on your phone. Something that isn’t abruptly loud, something that isn’t very exciting, something that just plays and you can watch.

Then just watch YouTube until you fall asleep.

That’s it. But you have to accept that you have insomnia, aren’t going to get a full night of sleep, aren’t going to fall asleep as soon as you lie down, etc. Anxiety is being hypervigilent, so you need to turn down your hypervigilence about falling asleep down as low as you can."
8490,h8e5qdn,,,insomnia,1628589425,Yep. But I actually leave the bed and go to the couch or the kitchen chair.

Use a good eye mask with eye space to block light.  Helps both with general insomnia and blue light imbalance but also light induced luteal phase shift.  If it’s luteal phase related, after your next period, allow two nights of light around day 12-14 and see if your cycle straightens out.   No promises but it’s an easy try"

If this persists you should see a doctor, but for tonight try some warm no caffeinated beverage like tea or hot chocolate to calm down.  Step away from your phone and other electronics the light isn't helping.  Pick up a book and read some once you feel your eyes getting heavy and you start to nod off don't stop just pass out and let go. You will be ok when you wake up.  If you don't sleep before school start tomorrow try and take a nap or something when you get home. You need sleep to be successful. 
I sincerely hope this helps you."

8537,h8ce50m,,,insomnia,1628549827,"I did end up going back, and I am having the best sleep of my life! 7 hours a night and little trouble falling asleep &lt; 15 minutes. It's honestly a miracle after struggling with sleep for so long. I am finally getting relief. Actually, I think the most effective things I do for sleep are 4 things in order of importance. Also, one day I just gave up on sleep aids (since they don't even work on me) and I have not looked back (2-3 weeks ago):

1. Wake up at 640 AM every day and start EVERY day with exercise (I do \~70 minutes) 30 minutes cardio and 30 minutes weight lifting
2. Keep room super cold I do 67 celsius around night time
3. Don't think about insomnia throughout day or at night just distract yourself or focus on breathing 
4. Weighted blanket at night (helps with relaxing)

Really the most impactful thing has been exercising every day every morning. Everything else is less important. I know because I spent a week on my friend's couch to experiment and I slept fine w/o coldness, weighted blanket, and a comfortable bed. 

If you are really struggling with sleep I HIGHLY recommend trying out working out 90 minutes a day in the mornings for 1 week (it's a huge commitment but your body and mind will thank you). This is coming from someone who has struggled to sleep all my life and just came out of an almost year long chronic insomnia hole."

After 25 years of doing this I had a complete breakdown due to the insomnia and was hospitalized. The hospital started me on meds which literally saved my life. I was then able to have a happy life and very successful career due to meds which I am still on.

I would just advise caution against ""whistling through the graveyard"" with insomnia for too long. Insomnia has health consequences and needs to be acknowledged and managed by any means necessary. Don't play with insomnia or think that you are stronger than it. It can take you down."

Basically it is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in boom form. Heard great things about it. 

Just know that even on little sleep, you will be able to function the next day and it will be okay. Just focus on enjoying the time of relaxation with no responsibilities. Nothing to fix. Nothing to do. Just chilling in peace and harmony. 

Easier said than done, but sometimes it works."

I find myself browsing this sub for a few weeks, then returning to my normal sleep routing then back here again wondering if “this time is worse”.  You didn’t lose the ability to sleep. You are just having anxiety about sleeping that is preventing sleep. It’s a bad cycle but again you will have restful nights. I’m currently in a bad run of two weeks with 1-2 hours of sleep max but I’m just riding the wave as best I can. 

There is something to be said for the strategy of not blocking out uncomfortable thoughts but accepting them as just that, thoughts, then pushing them aside. Supposedly overtime your brain will no longer react with stress to these thoughts and instead remain calm and not on alert. 

Trying this now on my end."

He also has a mobile app (paid app, not free) called “BedTyme” which is one-on-one coaching services (over text message). I used it for about two months and it really helped. However, the app is obviously optional and the YouTube videos are great regardless."

Trying to meditate feels too hard. I took some CBD but it didn’t help much. You’ll be ok. I have been going on like this for at least 3-4 weeks. While I wake up with massive anxiety it subsides some before night time. When night comes I try my hardest to prepare and accept it, but it gets overwhelmingly difficult. I get super envious of those around me who can sleep. I think it will get more accepting over time. Just know you’re not alone in this."

8584,h8agcao,,,insomnia,1628519617,"UV light therapy is where as soon as you wake you sit in front of a UV lamp for about 10 to 20 minutes.  It should re wire you so no matter what you wake up at that time and therefore causing you to feel sleepy at night.  It forces a normal sleep cycle.  Tryptophan is basically a turkey dinner, the tryptophan becomes serotonin and that will help your circadian rhythm.  The tryptophan might be hard to come by but I think you will be able to find the uv lamp over there.

By 5am to 6am, i would ready myself to sleep again in hopes i am tired enough. most days, i get 3hrs more, other days I would need to get up and power through the day.

I have stopped doing that 2 months ago and did a lot of very strict sleep hygiene. To this day, I still have insomnia with 2-3x awekings every night but I function well during the day.

I have started vaping delta-8 THC, which I tolerate a lot better than delta-9. It seems to help me get to sleep, but I have never found anything, even heavy pharmaceutical sedatives, that can keep me asleep. I also sometimes use a CBN tincture if I’m having a very wired night, I think it can help, especially on top of all the other cannabis medicinals that I use, sort of an entourage effect."

12 years ago.

My fear of where my life goes with my fucked up psyche and the missing comfort of good rest and deep sleep is increased since corona started.

Its very egoistic from me, wanting to save my own ass in any way.. but im scared to death.

You can find it in over-the-counter sleep meds as well as in nausea or flu medication. But do try them out well before the trip - I've found that some brands knock me out for 15 hours and leave me drowsy for two days, while others barely have an effect on me at all. 

If you get dimenhydrinate or doxylamine in nausea or flu meds, make sure they don't contain caffeine- sometimes they add stuff to combat the ""side effect"" (in your case it's the desired effect) of sleepiness."

When I stopped smoking and went back to pils it took me quite a little while to figure out what is going to work at what moment. It’s possible you just need to readjust your body again.

8623,h89jpu9,,,insomnia,1628497867,Same. I’ve also had this problem since I was a little girl. People don’t realize how truly debilitating it can be! I’d say quetiapine (seroquel) is definitely worth a shot but try to find the lowest effective dose because it’s a pretty strong medication that isn’t originally intended for sleep. It really helped though and I was starting to think I was immune to all downers.

Nothing seems to work completely i don’t think I’ve ever had a night where I didn’t wake up in the middle of it.
8627,h89i4jx,,,insomnia,1628496414,"Similar thing happened to me several years back at the height of my insomnia. I built a giant tolerance to benzos. But after not taking them for two years, I recently took one and was hoping for some nice relaxation as it slowly put me to sleep. Well, it made me tried for sure but not in a nice way. Just in a groggy kind of depressed way. It’s as though my general tolerance has faded a bit but the euphoria tolerance is still there in full-force. 

After benzos, z-drugs, trazadone, etc. failed to control my insomnia, I finally switched to quetiapine and that really helped me sleep. I started out on a super high dose of 300mg but after successfully managing my depression with medication and therapy, I only require ~10mg to sleep and sometimes none at all. 

Whatever your case may be, it might be good to pursue options other than benzos. I’m sure you already know a lot of the downsides of using them long-term but the worst part is just how much they lose effectiveness. Good luck!"

8634,h89cezq,,,insomnia,1628491444,"Maybe sleep apnea?  It can cause awakenings and is very common.  You could also be trying to go to sleep earlier than your body wants, so maybe when you have a day off, just go to bed 2 or 3 hours later than usual and see if you fall asleep easier. 

Look at your melatonin supplement for actual mcg of melatonin.  Less than 1000 mcg/1 gram is what's usually recommended, even though in the US they sell it 10x stronger."

8647,h893j09,,,insomnia,1628484604,"Yes, you do have insomnia. But I think this type of case is very common and you can resolve it easily without stress. Look more into sleep hygiene, but I don't recommend doing anything rash like extreme sleep restriction (staying up to feel tired next day) or lowering sleep time incrementally. It might actually worsen your insomnia, from my experience.

As long as you have a sleep schedule NOW, and can sleep even though it's at messed up times then it's ok. After that, you can consult this subreddit more or find a sleep therapist to better resolve your insomnia.

8649,h8921hp,,,insomnia,1628483610,"Seasonal resurfacing insomnia does indeed exist, but it's hard to attribute a certain reason as to what caused the insomnia exactly. If you don't believe it's the temperature, I'm more inclined to believe the difference in light exposure (daylight savings) in summer affect your circadian rhythm.

That doesn't happen to most people. So in this case it would mean you have a relatively delicate sleep schedule that can be ruined very easily. If sleep hygiene isn't effective, then you probably do have insomnia.

Can you give more information regarding change in environmental factors when summer comes?"

You might notice you're yawning or staring blank at something. Or trouble concentrating, that's where the microsleep happens. It last only one to a few seconds each time.

So. You're gonna be alright.

Change of environment before bed seems like a good idea."

8666,h88hqr7,,,insomnia,1628472109,Lay in the sun or go to a pool all day. It will help get vitamin d and also get you tired. Drink vitamin d in pill form and use magnesium (Drs best) when you're trying to sleep. Use chamomile tea as well. Wish you the best. I did this to overcome my insomnia. If you can also exercise a bit and then take a shower and when you're trying to sleep set the temperature to low so that you get cold and cozy.

Try in-bed relaxation methods like deep breathing to help yourself fall back asleep, and also be sure not to sleep in or nap excessively later, as either can steal from sleep at night."
8671,h88ds3u,,,insomnia,1628470056,"U definitely shouldn't feel alone on this. I've had chronic insomnia for years now. It really dampers my mood and makes my anxiety/depression worse. I can tell a huge difference in my mood from having 0 hours of sleep to just 3 hours. It really makes a difference, especially when you don't sleep for days back to back.

Have you gone to a sleep specialist or talked to your Dr about it? If it's really becoming a problem for you, they can give you medications to help you sleep."

8673,h88b4ol,,,insomnia,1628468678,"Hey yeah i completely agree with you. The base issue is i am struggling with heavy traumatic experiences right now and am in constant fight or flight mode, with the overwhelming anxiety and hypervigilance which comes with that. Im on lexapro and i do have ativan PRN. I try really hard to not use the ativan every night but ive been using it more the longer the insomnia drags put because we havent found any other pills that work and the longer this goes on the more wound up about it i get. I worry every night i take it that thay will be the night it doesnt work soooo that doesnt help things. I def need to go up on the lexapro bc im only on 10 mg but im terrified to do that bc i worry it will make it even harder to sleep (i do take it in the morning but im very sensitive to meds). I do have an excellent trauma therapist and she is helping me but the process takes time.

Im seeing a functional medicine MD on thursday and ive reached out to a behavioral sleep specialist who is a psychologist with a phd so hopefully one of them can help me with this symptom while i work on processing my trauma with my therapist. Thank you for your input!"
8674,h88ahfb,,,insomnia,1628468346,Magnesium supplements at bedtime have been a game changer. But I still wake up around 4am most mornings.
8675,h88ac0m,,,insomnia,1628468271,"Hi! Thanks for your reply. I have been working with MDs to address this but up to this point theyve all been psychiatrists and I have been really displeased with how theyve all relied so heavily on pills that have tons of side effects and can present a lot of problems to come off of. I need to see psychiatrists anyways to manage my depression and anxiety but they just have not been doing a good job of treating my insomnia. Im extremely sensitive to medication and I simply cant handle heavy duty psych meds like mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, even stuff like trazodone and amitriptyline make me feel so awful and agitated that they just make the insomnia worse. Americans consume 75% of the worlds prescription medication so there is clearly a widespread problem with overprescribing here.

 I messaged a woman here in Atlanta yesterday who is a psychologist with a phd and specializes in behavioral treatments for sleep, i am hoping to hear from her office this week. I really dont think i have sleep apnea (although im open to be proven wrong) im ""just"" extremely traumatized and in constant fight or flight mode and have the  overwhelming anxiety that comes with that. I have a really good trauma therapist but the process takes time. I will hold off on the yoga and meditation as you suggested, i also work on cross stitch which is easier to keep my attention on and is very calming. Thanks again for your input 💜"
8676,h889gw6,,,insomnia,1628467829,I can’t be for sure. All I know is I haven’t been able to sleep even with medication. I am usually tired all day and when it’s time to try to sleep at night I have all this restless energy. I even try exercise. I’m hoping it passes and isn’t FFI.

If you get up at 10 and your circadian rhythm is anchored there, you won't have enough sleep pressure until 2 am, 8h before. It's like jet lag. The way to fix this is to get up at a consistent time in the morning, get enough bright light exposure in the morning and daytime (from the sun, or a SAD lamp). Also helps to avoid blue light emitting electronics in the hour before bed as this suppresses melatonin production.

8715,h86skro,,,insomnia,1628442770,"Without medication it's going to be difficult to improve your sleep without first addressing your anxiety.  Whatever it is that's causing that really needs to b addressed.  

I would try CBTi, specifically SRT, for your onset insomnia but you will likely have maintenance issues until you can get your baseline daily anxiety reduced.  

In these instances I'm a fan of benzos if you don't have addiction or abuse tendencies.  An antidepressant like mirtazapine would probably also be helpful so that you can get some actual test to help break the cycle.  But you really need to address the root cause of our baseline anxiety for a long term solution."

Meantime there's many other ways to relax and unwind besides yoga -- find something that works for you personally.

I have gained more weight than ever before in this time period an I believe a significant cause of it was elevated cortisol levels. I just wanted tonday that melatonin isn't for everyone. I myself had extremely vivid nightmares on it, but I pretty much only have nightmares when I do sleep. If it doesn't work for you then you could try otc sleeping aids. Don't do what I do and snack all night like the previous poster said. If you can find a way to exert yourself physically try it out frequently. Best of luck"

When I was really focusing on my sleep, the panic and anxiety will always sink in through the night but when I go to bed knowing that regardless of the broken sleep, i still have the capability to sleep, i get to rest.

Sure, broken sleep can be annoying but even normal people gets waken up sometime through the night. There can still be improvement to my sleep but I no longer want to be pressured into thinking that I should need 8 hours of continuous sleep. I don’t want to force it anymore. I haven’t had a single sleepless night in 2 months."

Here’s what I did

Go up at a reasonable time, I usually wake up about 8:30 so I go up at 10:30 and read for an hour…. You have to pick a light read, easy book to calm you down and help you sleep, first it will seem ages you have been reading then you get used to it and now I just don’t wait the hour, but turn out the light when that drowsy feeling comes

I took melatonin and magnesium glycinate which worked for a while but then stopped working. I just slept yesterday first time without anything and got a really good rest even if it wasn’t the ‘8’ hours

You gotta stop hoping for 8/7 hours and instead be happy with any sleep you get. Don’t stress about it, life could be a lot worse even if it doesn’t feel that way at the moment.

I tried unisom and nytol, they helped knock me out but I didn’t want to get reliant so stopped taking them. Or just get old school allergy pills.

Another thing is don’t label yourself an insomniac, or think about it. Every night I watch the Simpsons to distract myself. Carry on living life, force yourself to exercise, go study, go work, spend time with family…. Pretend you slept through the night.

I have heard go downstairs if you can’t sleep and get out of bed but personally that didn’t work for me, I stay in bed and think about a story, I imagine I’m on an airplane (fond childhood memories) or on holiday with my family, something laid back…. I plan my next holiday, or I imagine I am on a train to nowhere

Also, I always sleep worse if I go eat a snack and I can’t sleep, always have your dinner around 7/8 if you sleep about 11/12, and try not eat anything after unless you actually have stomach hunger pain, then go eat something like I found boiled eggs, tuna, oatmeal helped me weirdly.

About the weight, I am an amateur boxer and was worried when I gained weight not sleeping, it’s just water weight from stress and cortisol, remind yourself you will lose is as soon as you fix your sleep, your sleep is more important than gaining a few pounds long term, I lost it very quickly after because I was more active and well rested"

8786,h85ln3v,,,insomnia,1628417984,"I would suggest: Keep living with your family. Take a gap year (although maybe 6 months would be better) but be sure to do something healthy and stimulating during that time, ideally somewhat physically demanding.

You could... volunteer to do park maintenance. Or take a job if you can arrange things with the employer that they aren't depending on you so you can take time off when you need to, show up when it works... and take lower pay to make it worth their while. Landscaping maybe. Home repair may work as well. 

Let yourself relax about your insomnia. Practice good sleep hygiene (I know long term insomniacs are usually sick of that phrase). Have your days be low stakes. See what happens.

Being in high school is high stress usually. If you can take the stress out of the equation for awhile, you will find out how much of it is actually insomnia, sleep disorder, etc, and how much of it was stress.

Stress is really prone to creating vicious cycles that create more stress, so just learning to break that cycle will help you immensely with sleep and the rest of life, too. I am not saying the sleep problems will go away (although it could happen), but that it helps.

You may need professional help to fully break the stress cycle even without school."

I was on quetiapine (seroquel) for three years starting at 300mg a day and weening down to 25mg. I was happy enough to take it at the time as I’d been told the side effects involved some weight gain but otherwise it was perfectly safe. Please note this is very much not the case. The drug antagonises neural pathways to the point of killing a significant number of neutrons across the brain, leading to visible shrinking of the brain, this of course causes brain damage in multiple ways. I have myself been left with daily involuntary muscle tremors (dystonia) caused by the drug’s damage to the Basal Ganglia in the centre of the brain, more extensive use of the drug can cause full blown dementia.

I couldn't stop throwing up for the next two hours, it was brutal af. They gave me 20mg of Valium when we got to the hospital, and it might as well of been sugar pills because it didn't put me to sleep, nor did it make me feel any better.

8814,h85cp8g,,,insomnia,1628409818,I know we keep going through the nights but one day we'll get better.
8815,h85cn3x,,,insomnia,1628409767,Go see a doctor. Especially if this is a new experience and you don’t know why.
8816,h85acka,,,insomnia,1628407807,What you’re describing sounds v familiar. Earlier this year when this was going on I couldn’t sleep for days which shifted into intense anxiety about lying down. Feeling of falling to my death whenever I shut my eyes. I had a seizure later in hospital and was wondering if they were connected. On late day 2 now and hoping I’ll nod off at some point. Thank you so much for the advice.
8817,h8592ee,,,insomnia,1628406702,"Dude, spot on. That's exactly how I felt. At the time that happened, I worked night shift, so my boss (who's also still one of my best friends) was the only person I'd really talk to. The hospital he took me to was the one I worked at, and I knew basically all the nursing staff there that night, and I didn't hardly talk to anyone except the head nurse because I knew her really well. Told her I feel like I'm legit going crazy, and I feel like I'm going to break at any moment and do something stupid to myself. They were cool about it.

I never want to get to that point again, but I might be riding the line close. It's been about 2 days and 15 hours since I've slept. I'm starting to get the weird feelings. Nothing otc is working. Two nights ago I took 15mgs of ambien and didn't sleep at all, last night at about 9:00pm I took 30mgs of ambien (getting very desperate) and 10mgs of melatonin and it's now 3:11am here and I didn't sleep at all after taking the ambien.

Shit sucks dude, but hopefully one day it'll get better."
8818,h858q1j,,,insomnia,1628406412,Interesting. Do you have any articles that talk about this or idea about reasons why? This is just a pattern you noticed in yourself?
8819,h858f0k,,,insomnia,1628406158,Can relate. I've had a sleep deprivation and had the same symptoms at the start of day 3. On day 5 the amount of pain in the head is the same as getting hit by a truck. And after day 4 I started having a hard time with paranoia and basic human conversations. Like saying hello was a big challenge cause everything was a mase in my mind. If you can sleep the pain is not worth the time saving.
8820,h857ous,,,insomnia,1628405560,"Lol, I took 30mg of ambien tonight and I'm still awake 5 hours later.

Aside from that useless point, I have read that ambien does cause and surpress REM sleep. No idea about hydroxyzine (that's about the only med my Dr hasn't put me on)."
8821,h857o1j,,,insomnia,1628405542,I don't have any deficiency but thanks for the help
8822,h857gtc,,,insomnia,1628405379,"I feel you, especially that sleep schedule you have going on. I'm usually up 23 hours a day, then get an hour of sleep if I'm lucky. If it's real bad, I'll be up for 3-4 days before I get any sleep.

Definitely getg some help from your Dr. I'm starting to get to that point. I use to be a cop and also worked security at a hospital for a while. I saw a lot of shit. I'm seeing a new psychiatrist and she's the first one to even ask me if I might have ptsd (really never though I did). So she got me off of klonopin, put me on prozac and gabapentin.

I did have ""insomnia provoked seizures"" on July 6th, which I didn't know was a thing. Now I can't drive until December. My quality of life has really gone down hill since then. I had depression pretty bad before, but now it's at a all time high. Haven't self harmed in over a year, but I do have suicidal ideations everyone once in a while, if I'm being honest.

Definitely do what you can to get better homie. If you have any questions or just need to vent/talk, I'm here for you homie.

Don't give up. Once you give up that's when you loose. I've seen that too many times, don't be another number. There's plenty of us out here, reach out if need be. Keep on rockin dude, we all got this. We're all in it together, even if you feel alone in the world. Good luck man"
8823,h8577a0,,,insomnia,1628405161,Thank you! Your comment give me a little bit of hope. I'll go to my doctor tomorrow and see if your suggestions can help me up a bit.
8824,h856wwp,,,insomnia,1628404926,"For me personally, about halfway through day 4, with literally no sleep (no cat naps, no dosing off, nothing) was enough for me to call it quits.

I started having audio/visual hallucinations and called my boss and asked him to take me to the hospital we worked at. They gave me a 1mg shot of Ativan, and he took me home, and then I passed out for a hour, then I woke back up, said fuck it, and took 8mg of klonopin and that was enough to put me asleep for about 5 hours.

If you ever start feeling really funny (youll know the feeling), or start hearing and seeing shit, it's probably time to go to the hospital.

Not to scare or anything, but I learned first hand you can have insomnia provoked seizures (happened to me). Go to your primary Dr/walk in clinic and see if they'll prescribe you something for insomnia."
8825,h856moe,,,insomnia,1628404696,I don't think it exists. In France at least. We searched for but didn't find any.
8826,h856iiv,,,insomnia,1628404601,"it's strange, because i was completely fine for some months now, but then all of the sudden i started having sleep problem again some weeks ago (i used to have them but then they almost completely dissapeared last year) i think i'll just try to stay awake this night and then reset my sleep cycle to see if it solves anything."
8827,h856gr6,,,insomnia,1628404561,"Idk if it's from the seizures, or the gabapentin they put me on, or my upped dosage of prozac, but I get these really random and really ""violent"" body jerks. Like I'll just be sitting in my chair or laying on the bed and one of my arms or legs will jump (like if you just watched a jump scare video), but it's only in that extremity.

It's fucking annoying. I look like a tweaker now because of it. The little bit of sleep I do get, if I'm around anyone, I still do it in my sleep.

When I went to the hospital for the seizures, mom and dad said if I fell asleep any, I would twitch incredibly hard and sometimes it'd wake me up.

Overall, the quality of life has really gone down hill and it's made my depression worse. Not to mention I feel super foggy headed all the time. My memory has gone to shit too. Hopefully it gets better."
8828,h8562oa,,,insomnia,1628404252,"I can confirm. I used to assist stroke victims, those with PSP, Spina abifida, and hospice patients with ADLs and it was a pain dealing with an employer who wanted to write me up anytime I had issues with sleep. People who haven't been in caregiving don't know how badly you and the client can get injured. Smfh"

8833,h8529ix,,,insomnia,1628401341,"I disagree. As long as your drinking water, eating relatively healthy lifestyle, it will not have long term consequences. 

I think 6-9 hours a night is ideal. 5 is not great, but acceptable and 5 or less is bad. 

This is my opinion and what I’ve gathered from my research. Some might disagree. 

I will say quality of sleep matters as well. 6 straight hours is better then 8 hours of fragmented sleep. Quality over quantity 

I would love to be in your position. I’ve been getting 2-4 hours a night of broken sleep."

8839,h84yk27,,,insomnia,1628398685,"I’d had insomnia since I was a very young girl as well. I grew a tolerance to all medications very quickly and therapy didn’t help me. I formed a short addiction to opioid painkillers which helped but led to other issues. The first thing to help me long-term was quetiapine. But after I my short addiction to painkillers, I was put on the medication buprenorphine to help me get sober. That medication has been a miracle for me. It has helped my depression and anxiety in a massive way and now I sleep consistently well. I never thought it would happen but I’m 29 and sleeping well every night for the first time since I was 12. It’s been this way for about two years now. 

Don’t give up. Insomnia can make you feel crazy and it takes away all your energy. Some doctors really don’t know how to treat it though so you need to do your own research and make suggestions to the doctor. Things you want to try. I hope you find a solution. Good luck!"

. I tend to wake up a few times during the night. Also, during most- if not all mornings- I'll wake up and go back to sleep about 3 times before finally waking up properly.


. I have autism, which is why I'm kind of on the fence about whether it's a separate sleeping problem or the autism just messing with my brain more.


. Sometimes even when I'm tired I can't sleep, for example once it was like 6am and I kept yawning so I was lying down and trying to sleep but it took me until about 9am to be able to sleep proper.


. I usually operate on less hours of sleep than average, usually about 5/6hrs per night and 2/3hrs at the worst. It doesn't usually effect me that bad but sometimes I'll just get ridiculously exhausted and sleepy out of nowhere.

Symptoms of DSP include:  
  
A delayed sleep pattern in relation to desired sleep and wake times  
Trouble falling asleep at the desired bedtime  
Inability to wake up in the morning  
Normal duration and quality of sleep when there is no need to go to sleep or wake up at a specific time

From my personal experience, I believe that if it’s everyday that you have coffee, it influences your insomnia, even if it’s hours later. But, what happens to my organism might be different from what happens to your organism
You could try by reducing little by little, I would recommend! For instance, if you have two cups, you could start having only one and then only one every 2 days a week, until you’re able to reduce more and more. Sometimes, however, I myself have regular coffee cause I really enjoyed it, but I do my best to avoid it as much as I can."
8876,h84f18f,,,insomnia,1628387207,"To be honest you might only need just 3 to 4 hours of sleep.  You might be one of those people who's body only requires minimal sleep,  especially if you say the problem has been there since 8 years old....I think you're stressing yourself out because you see everyone else requires 8 or more and you're thinking there's something wrong with you. When in fact there might not be anything wrong. The great  Sadguru believes that we do fine on just 3 hours of sleep as long as you find rest throughout the day that doesn't involve deep sleep...could be meditation, relaxing in bed, or even deep breathing exercises. Modernization and our western doctors will tell us we ALL must get 8 hours of sleep but everyone is different! Every single body is different.  What my body needs is not what your body needs......of course we'll believe them so big pharma can go on selling us more miracle pills to solve our problems in which some cases never existed in the first place.  Insomnia becomes a problem in my opinion when its directly interfering with your health or daily life. Don't let it control your life is all I can suggest. You give power to a problem it'll feed off of you...accept the 4 hours of sleep and try to forget it  .... I'm taking my own advice as well"

If a psychologist has been involved and you say you have gone to a psychiatric hospital this sounds like a really serious issue especially as it started when you were so young. I wonder if something happened to you when you were 8 and you need a psychiatrist to help you explore that?

I’m in the U.K. and I struggle to sleep properly. A short while after my problems started I found out that it was only until relatively recently that people slept in 2 chunks of 4 hours per night.

https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-in-two-shifts-maybe-we-should-again

You’re waking after your first cycle of sleep and can’t get back to sleep for the second. When lockdown started I managed to get into a rhythm where if I went to bed early I could sleep for 4 hours, be awake for 2 hours then sleep again for another 3 or 4 but obviously you have to get into bed around 11 hours before you want to get up.

I think part of your problem now is the huge amount of stress wrapped up in this situation. If you accept you are not sleeping well for now, as in don’t fight it anymore, that might help to start with. Are you on school holidays? Can you use this time to try everything you can to improve your sleep? Have you tried melatonin tablets? I can’t believe you were given a form of opium at your age."

If I'm just a little tired when reading and I try to fall asleep it doesn't work.  I have to nearly have the kindle fall out of my hand. I know everyone is different but how long do you normally read?

I recently have tried l-theanine bc of what I heard on a podcast.  I thought it was working up until the last two nights...no luck anymore.  Worked for almost 1.5wks but 1 wk I was on vacation.  How much l-theanine/magnesium do you take and how soon before bed?

The truth: most likely there is nothing you could do that would convince your father. Based on what you say, his believes seem deeply rooted. So it would be unrealistic to expect any support from him in that area, especially on the emotional level.

8941,h82y6g3,,,insomnia,1628360371,"I'm curious as to how you feel in 12-14 hours.  If you feel ""normal"" tired then it's a good sign that you slept.  And I focus on details like my eyes and stuff too, I do it to confirm my suspicions. It's probably bad though because before I had sleep issues I never cared about those things. I was either tired or I wasn't.  No big mystery to it.  Hang in there buddy!"
8942,h82xjog,,,insomnia,1628360074,"I think that's certainly possible. As for my eyes, they feel irritated on the outer edges but could very easily be allergy related.

8943,h82x4p0,,,insomnia,1628359883,"I used to get out of bed and put a blanket down and lay on the floor. Sounds crazy but it worked for me, eventually I’d fall asleep."
8944,h82vvve,,,insomnia,1628359308,AH YES that makes so much sense!! idk why i haven’t done that. no wonder my cycle just keeps putting me to sleep at 4 then waking up at 12pm. thank you so much!!
8945,h82vuay,,,insomnia,1628359288,"I had this problem too, I felt dread just thinking about laying in bed.  My therapist suggested that I try falling asleep watching TV or YouTube in my recliner. I've never been able to sleep in anything but my bed or very rarely a couch so I was very skeptical that this would work.  However, I felt less dread in the recliner and that eased my anxiety.  I did sleep!  Then I would wake a few hours later and move to my bed where the pressure was off so I could sleep normally.  I did this for several nights and eventually the dread of bed went away and I was able to transition back to just my bed."
8946,h82v4ar,,,insomnia,1628358952,"I totally felt this in the past. Sleep filled me with dread. Now I put my head on the pillow and I pretty much pass out within 20-30 minutes. 

I recommend starting every morning with a power walk outside. I also recommend going outside multiple times a day and looking up (not directly into the sun of course). It helps regulate your melatonin and signal to your body that you need to be awake. I wind down by watching ncis in a dark room and stretching on a yoga mat. I basically just listen and occasionally look at the screen. I stretch for approx 40 minutes and use a foam roller as well as 2 lacrosse balls down my spine and hamstrings. This REALLY relaxes my body. Releasing the built up tension around my shoulder blades and on the pressure points has made a world of a difference. I also fall asleep to the same guided meditation every night. I find that consistency is the key in maintaining a regular sleep schedule. 

I think a big portion of it is a mindset shift. I don’t know how I did it but I don’t dread sleep anymore honestly. Thinking about sleep as the enemy pretty much guarantees you will not sleep. 

Can you try sleeping in a different room? Sometimes switching my environment helps me."
8947,h82v0uf,,,insomnia,1628358908,I've felt similarly before although I tend to go the other way.  I usually like to assume I slept twenty minutes here and there when I'm laying in bed for hours before actually getting real sleep.  And this is only opinion but I believe that if you don't remember several hours at a time then you must have been asleep.
8948,h82uz32,,,insomnia,1628358886,Mine makes me warm but if I had the money to splurge I’d buy a more expensive one that is supposed to be cooler.

8953,h82tdbv,,,insomnia,1628358158,"I see. The key when attempting to shift your circadian rhythm (advancing it in this case) is not to go to bed earlier, it's to get up earlier. You have to shift first in order to yield enough sleep pressure at 9:30, that will take a few days."
8954,h82sq4n,,,insomnia,1628357865,I love Dr hubermans work and podcast 🙏
8955,h82rjbq,,,insomnia,1628357329,"I agree, people don't post enough success stories on here. I'll bet it's because once people heal, they don't want to come back here. 

I've definitely gotten way better. I don't want to use the word ""beat"" because of course I still have nights where I can't sleep every once in a while, but that's way better than not sleeping for multiple nights in a row like I used to.

For me, it was a combination of a lot of things. Of course learning to somewhat control my anxiety through exercise and meditation helped a lot. But I think the biggest thing for me was starting to read a lot before bed. No matter what, I always put my phone away, turn off the TV, and just read my kindle until I actually get really tired. Sometimes it takes longer than other times, but that's okay, as long as I get tired eventually."

8962,h82q8kf,,,insomnia,1628356729,"I was on every med for insomnia. I either required too high of a dose (30mg of ambien nightly for a 100lb female isn’t good and it didn’t work after a week) or I grew a tolerance very quickly. What finally worked for me long-term was seroquel. I started out on too high of a dose (300mg) and developed a lot of trouble waking up. But my depression and anxiety and insomnia couple with the sudden death of my mother led me to a short-lived but intense opioid addiction. That in turn led me to the medication buprenorphine. It’s usually used to help people with opioid addiction but for me, it just fixed everything. My depression and anxiety are now totally under control and I don’t need any sleeping aid most night. If I do I take ~10mg of seroquel. I’m 29 now and the past year and half is the first time since age 14 where insomnia hasn’t been at the center of my life. Good luck!"
8963,h82q4rb,,,insomnia,1628356680,That's great! How often do you get around to exercise?
8964,h82pzs1,,,insomnia,1628356615,"I think if your insomnia has an underlying cause, then it's very possible to cure it.

If, however, you have no underlying cause, and just suffer from lifelong insomnia, then it's probably never going to go away completely. Mine comes and goes. I'll get a couple of months where my insomnia kicks in, and I'll take zopiclone to sleep during that time. Then, I might get a couple of weeks or a month where I'm sleeping okay, and don't need the meds. I never sleep great without meds, but I will sleep enough to function fine during those weeks when my insomnia isn't bad.

Moral is, enjoy the times when your insomnia isn't bad, or goes away for awhile. If you can treat it with meds when it's bad, do that. It's very manageable if you treat it like that."

8966,h82mdtb,,,insomnia,1628354937,"Insomnia ruled my life from a young age. I had depression and anxiety and the insomnia made both infinitely worse. It was literally ruining my life. Most medications didn’t help me or didn’t help me long-term. I’d steer clear of the typical ambien and benzos. I made the mistake of relying on those too much. Finally I was given seroquel at night to sleep and it’s the only med that has worked long-term for me (been at least five years now). I started out on 300mg a night which is a lot. It was too much, I started having a lot of trouble waking up. I’m now at ~10mg and sometimes I forget. But it was a game changer for getting my insomnia under control on a consistent basis. Then I was I able to get my depression and anxiety under control with therapy and medication. Now I find that insomnia doesn’t rule my life. The depression and anxiety were likely the underlying conditions causing my insomnia so now that I have them in line, insomnia is so, so much better. People don’t take insomnia seriously enough. It’s such a horrible thing to deal with, I’m really sorry you’re going through this. I hope you find what works for you!"

Eat earlier in the evening don’t do anything with electronics and or anything that could get you mentally bothered and take an over the counter sleep pill. Then relax don’t even try and sleep. If you wake up do what I do and then if you feel tired go back to bed. Don’t ever do anything in bed besides sleep and sex. I was taught all this in a sleep clinic it’s called sleep hygiene.

8982,h82f81b,,,insomnia,1628351575,"If lack of nutrition during the day is causing bad sleep/awakenings at night, then unfortunately this will only perpetuate the awakenings, creating a vicious cycle that can only be stopped with proper nutrition during the day -- especially protein, the lack of which is what drives hunger the most (plus protein is also needed for the proper production of serotonin and melatonin).

If you struggle to get enough protein due to depression, a whey protein powder shake can help, as it's easier to take than consuming the same amount of protein from solid food."
8983,h82f382,,,insomnia,1628351512,"oh okay i see, someone else mentioned that as well so will definitely look i to that. thank you so much !"
8984,h82e56o,,,insomnia,1628351067,"Yes! I know what you mean about this sub, but I empathize with the sufferers. 

I had severe insomnia and disrupted sleep for several years but got through it. 

The changes I made were to really research insomnia. One book that helped was The Sleep Solution by Dr Chris Winter. 

core to the changes I made was better understanding the difference between fatigue and sleepiness. Fatigue is the “tired” feeling that you get but you’re not ready to fall asleep. I learned to cope with this in different ways than just laying in bed trying to sleep. Some ways I would handle fatigue:

- meditation
- exercise
- hydration
- a bit of caffeine in the AM

To help improve sleep, I focused on quality, not quantity:

- only being in bed when sleepy, not just fatigued
- consistent wake times, coupled with exercise 
- not obsess over the magic “8 hours” because it’s just an average. I can often do with less (6-7 hours) if sleep is good quality. Don’t force yourself into bed too early, sometimes I go to bed midnight or 1 am and wake at 7 am…
- magnesium. My sleep doctor said this is the most consistently helpful supplement 
- Short post lunch nap if needed. It’s somewhat normal for some to feel sleepy post lunch, as long as it’s a power nap (20-30 mins), this can be healthy. 
- normal good sleep hygiene. I read a paper book before bed…

There’s also a bidirectional link between insomnia and depression/anxiety. Seeing someone to help with general mental health can help sleep. 

There’s many conditions that can cause sleep issues. For me I have periodic limb movements (like restless legs, but in deep sleep).

If you’re too fatigued to track your insomnia issues and various doctor appointments, I highly recommend taking a loved one to appointments to advocate for you. Doctors can be very different, some sadly want to get through their patients and don’t seem to quite get it. In a massively fatigued state, you might not be assertive enough. So an advocate is very helpful!

Anyway, this is another post of what helped me with related conditions:

I'm not usually a good sleeper but last night felt more normal - no sleep jerks, a few shoulder twitches here or there, but I managed to drift off much more normally. I'm hopeful it's getting better - exactly 4 weeks from my second dose now. 

I know. the docs have been almost useless. they fixate on curing the symptoms without thinking about the root cause. mine was good enough to acknowledge that the vaccines are pretty unknown and the side effects not comprehensively known, but I've heard of a lot of so called medical ""professionals"" blaming peoples' symptoms on coincidences or basically telling them it's all in their head. my roommate tried to blame it on the forest fire smoke in our area. like bitch I lived in Vancouver in 2017 through one of the worst fire seasons in the last decade. fire smoke doesn't cause neurological disfunction."
8988,h82a4xo,,,insomnia,1628349157,"You're taking steps towards recovery. You're about to talk to a professional. You're aware that there's a problem and you haven't lost your will to solve it. 

You have all the ingredients necessary to get better. It will be difficult af, but you can do it! Just remember to be gentle and loving towards yourself - progress is almost never linear, but even the smallest step counts.

I believe in you."
8989,h827mps,,,insomnia,1628347933,Pretty sure I'm borderline retarded and I'm going on day two with no sleep.
8990,h825qfn,,,insomnia,1628346984,"I Saud eating because I included people who has depression and might struggle to get the nutrition they need during the day, waking up with a hell of a stomach ache and messing accute nutrition.

I agree eating just because you're awake is not effective. But taking a small snack if you absolutely have to is ok. I sometimes take a few slices cheeze if I haven't eaten during the day. Just to calm the growling stomach ache."
8991,h8239ql,,,insomnia,1628345724,I leave the house and take long walks with some music in the background. it works sometimes and it's pretty chill too
8992,h820bir,,,insomnia,1628344165,"This is an essential piece of advice for insomnia in CBTi therapy because for many insomniacs, the bed-sleep association has been broken -- so lying in bed awake for hours only worsens that. Sleep restriction therapy leverages the same principle, by retraining the brain to associate the bed with sleep.

This is also why some insomniacs paradoxically sleep a lot better when they are traveling/sleeping somewhere else. 

I would, however, recommend against eating when you wake up during the night. This trains the brain to associate the reward of eating with waking up during the night, so it will keep waking you up the more you train it to expect food when waking up during the night. It also messes with your circadian rhythm -- as eating is a key driver of circadian rhythm, so it should only be done during the daytime/normal waking hours. And for night owls, eating late at night or during the night can shift their rhythm even later."
8993,h81znlv,,,insomnia,1628343804,"Nothing is wrong, don’t worry too much. You’re body is changing a lot at that age and the weather/season itself can also be a factor. From 15 to 21, I went through numerous phases of sleeping for days to not sleeping for days. I still don’t sleep sometimes, like right now, but I’ve come to embrace insomnia :))"
8994,h81ui4e,,,insomnia,1628340818,Yeah the book reading isn't for everyone. You're welcome! I hope it works for you.
8995,h81t4x4,,,insomnia,1628339989,Hmm.. Have you tried exercising more often?
8996,h81sypy,,,insomnia,1628339881,Not yet. They're not giving us permission to have it done until it's over 6 months since last time we got covid.
8997,h81q56z,,,insomnia,1628338033,"I'm not OP haha. I've actually mostly recovered from my insomnia, although it does resurface pretty badly from here to there. It's unfortunate that you have to find new medicine to work, how long have you been an insomniac?

I've actually stayed up 5 days without sleep or microsleep but I only had audial hallucinations and not visual ones at the time.

Hopefully my positive story will give you hope. I genuinely did not believe my insomnia would ever be cured. If you can feel positive in your worst state, you'll feel even better when you overcome the struggle of insomnia.

Instead of hating yourself, being anxious about sleep, excessively caring about sleep hygiene, or trying to meditate to calm the mind — it's better to just get angry. Not at yourself, but kind of at the world. Feel astonished at how shitty your circumstances are but don't give it too much care, if that makes sense. That means of catharsis and acceptance of insomnia contributed a lot to my recovery. Adopt a ""It is what it is"" mindset, and live life at your own pace.

In hindsight, insomnia equipped me with the tools to fix itself. The feeling of eternity as time is reversed just for you, in the middle of the night. It helped me understand myself and my body so much more, and matured me way significantly. That said, I would never suffer insomnia for those benefits.

I hope you don't give up either. Get some medication, get some sleep, over time sleep hygiene will become impactful again, don't waste your opportunities to sleep, but live life at your own pace. Good luck"
8998,h81oaxl,,,insomnia,1628336720,"Hey man, if it works for you, rock on with it. Personally for me it sucked, but if it makes a difference to you, then  fuck what anyone else says or thinks."
8999,h81o6zu,,,insomnia,1628336640,"28 yo here. I've had it since I was about 20. Self medicated every night with liquor for about 6 years, so i was basically drinking myself to sleep. I stopped drinking after I moved and made changes. Insomnia slowly crept its way back into life.

Buddy of mine introduced me to kratom, and it was downhill from there. I took kratom every day and night (worked from 6pm-6am) until it became an out of control addiction. Took it to help with mood improvement for when I was running on 2 hours of sleep or so. It helped for a while, then I became addicted to it and couldn't get off of it. It cost me my job (long story) and really fucked my life up.

February of 2020 I had to go to the ER after being up for 5 days and started having audio/visual hallucinations. They gave me a 1mg shot of Ativan. I went home, slept, and woke up after a hour.

Back on July 6th I had a ""insomnia provoked seizure"". Didn't know you could have seizures due to lack of sleep. I'm usually up for two to three days straight before I'll get about 4 hours of sleep, and then repeat. I'm on my 9th prescription med to try and help with sleep (gabapentin) and it isn't doing shit. About the only thing that worked was 7mg of klonopin, but my Dr took me off of klonopin like two weeks ago (didn't tell her I was taking 7mg because she would definitely think I was fucking with benzos for fun, which isn't the case).

I also was given some ambien from a family member, and while it use to work back in college, it doesn't anymore. I took 20mgs of ambien last night at 11:30pm and now it's 7:40am and I haven't had a second of sleep. The two nights before I took 15mgs and didn't sleep either.

Insomnia is a rough time my dude. Not having kratom to help with my mood is worse too. It's a vicious cycle. You get teased with sleep, or you're on the verge of falling asleep and then you just all of a sudden can't sleep and aren't tired anymore for the rest of the night.

I hate you, and so many other people, are dealing with it. It seriously makes life way more stressful and way more harder. It's not taken as seriously as it should be."
9000,h81n46u,,,insomnia,1628335850,"I don’t know of any with no side effects. Nytol works for me, but with spaciness and dry mouth next day. I’ve also been prescribed amitriptyline, which is very effective but *extremely* sedating. I also cry a lot the day after. I don’t mean I feel sad. I just cry."
9001,h81mrur,,,insomnia,1628335589,"Similar for me dude, all since I had my second moderna vaccine. Been reading around and a few people are experiencing. 

This is in no way an anti-vaxx post, fuck getting covid, but these seem to be side effects for me."
9002,h81mot6,,,insomnia,1628335523,Random question - have you had a vaccine for covid?
9003,h81mnx2,,,insomnia,1628335504,"When you are struggling to sleep like that - firstly get off devices, blue light is killing sleep!

But often we look to the mind, managing thougths, counting sheep etc etc 'when the mind is struggling, look to the body' Andrew Huberman. 

So think about breathing exercises. Try 5 in 7 out, put yourself into parasymathetic mode, and you'll slowly drift off."
9004,h81mhsr,,,insomnia,1628335373,"Just naturally resistant. I'm on my 9th prescription med for insomnia (gabapentin this time) and it isn't working either, anbd it's been about a month. So Dr will probably keep me on gaba for another month until we try something else.

I never thought it would have gotten this bad, but once the seizure happened it was just like what the fuck. Now I'm trying to stick to a sleep schedule/routine and working on positive thinking and shit like that, but my mindset isn't positive, and everything we try doesn't work, even though I'm trying my hardest to make it work.

Sorry to hear youre having such a rough time to with it dude. It's definitely not taken as seriously as it should be. Shit can really fuck your life up.

February of 2019 I had to go yo the hospital after being up for 4 days straight and hearing shit and seeing shit. I took more otc in one night then I ever had in a week. They gave me a 1mg shot of Valium, I went home, slept for a hour, and woke back up. I was also on klonopin for a bit over a year, and the only time it would knock me out is if I took 7mg of it. Unfortunately the Dr has taken that off my prescription list.

Everything's just a bitch when you can't sleep, and now it's amplified by not being able to drive. I feel stuck.

Don't give up though man. Find a sleep specialist and see what they say."
9005,h81mavg,,,insomnia,1628335223,"Feeling uncomfortable and finding certain noises irritating is a sign of many different conditions. However, I can assure you that it's most likely being irritated from insomnia and sleep deprivation.

When we stay in bed, expect ourselves to sleep, wait, starve after a few hours, etc. then we begin to associate our beds with not sleeping. You no longer perceive your bed as a place of blissful comfort, but rather annoyance and restlessness.

These problems will probably be resolved ONCE you get consistent sleep in. Reply if you want some help regarding that. Btw, I personally don't recommend taking another tablet of melatonin if you can't sleep. Since melatonin alerts our body to sleep, releasing melatonin at late times reinforce a bad sleep schedule. Also I don't know the validity of this, but many people including myself have experienced a phenomenon in which if melatonin doesn't put you to sleep then you stay up longer than you normally would."
9006,h81m8hs,,,insomnia,1628335171,"Honestly when I read this I thought to myself “Did you write this last night?”  

Going to work now and suffering greatly.  Wondering how I’m going to make it though the day. VERY high level responsibility job. 

I have no advice besides try CBT-I.  Scientifically/statistically it has the highest probability of helping you.  It’s helped me in the past then I went off track.  I’ve stated the program again.  I refuse to take regular meds.  I want to fix the root cause."
9007,h81lxwj,,,insomnia,1628334941,that sucks man. are you naturally resistant to ambien or did you adapt to it?
9008,h81lu4j,,,insomnia,1628334855,"You can message me more about this if you want. A few questions:

1. How quickly can you fall asleep?
2. Do you feel ""sleepy"" and if yes, can you sleep after feeling sleepy or are you unable to?
3. Is it possible for you to fall asleep after waking up?
4. When you wake up at an early time, how refreshed vs tired do you feel?
5. Does having an early wake affect the next time you sleep, as well?
6. Are you able to sleep at random times from 9pm to 3am?

I promise you nothing is wrong. Moreover, it is good that you are addressing this quickly. I am a bit concerned at your degree of worriness because what you've described to me doesn't seem relatively bad. No offence. What I mean is that do you have any other signs of worry (regarding insomnia) you haven't included in the post?

As for the light part, that is a very valid theory as to why you're waking so early. However, think to yourself about why it's only been happening recently (?). Why can you not fall back asleep, if you're tired?

I recommend watching some videos or doing very basic research about the terms: ""sleep hygiene"". ""blue light"", and ""circadian rhythm"". Don't worry, it's very easy to understand and there are some TED videos available which are nice."
9009,h81lbzv,,,insomnia,1628334440,I dunno.. I think its helping your Brain to produce enough dopamine to stop your neurons from firing all the time... Idk though
9010,h81l38o,,,insomnia,1628334240,They’re very hypnotic but they’re on the weak side for sure. 10mg temazepam is Equivalent to 0.25mg - 0.5mg clonazepam/alprazolam
9011,h81l0ty,,,insomnia,1628334187,Yeah we only have 10mg here in aus and docs freak out if you’re on more than 20mg
9012,h81klr2,,,insomnia,1628333840,I love your tips and can really relate. The insomnia will likely come back at some point but you'll get through it again. Having confidence that you will sleep again eventually helps build trust in yourself and lessens the sleep anxiety.
9013,h81kjbq,,,insomnia,1628333785,"Wow, someone finally mentioned my drug: Temazapam. I find so little information about it these days. Perhaps because it’s so old and not as prescribed as much anymore.

I was prescribed Temazapam about 10 years ago after trying several other sleep aids that didn’t work for me. Tammies worked for me right out of the gate.

Then 5 years ago, I developed a dependency on them, taking 30 mg per night. Now I am struggling really hard to wean myself off of them.

I’m surprised that you described Temazapam as a “weak” benzo. Perhaps my dosage (which I believe is the max you can get in the U.S.) is not “weak.”

I’m in the early stages of getting off of them and switched to a lower dosage (22.5) a week ago and this week has been horrible. I’m on a few benzos boards and have read a lot of horror stories about benzo withdrawal. I just wonder if withdrawals from Temazapam in particular are not as bad or lengthy."
9014,h81k7yw,,,insomnia,1628333519,"Fuck seroquel lol. Took it for three days and couldn't stand how zombified it made me, plus it didn't make me sleep once."
9015,h81j5hn,,,insomnia,1628332603,"You tapered off, this greatly assists the brains healing, diminishes adverse withdrawals, rebound insomnia and the length of time it’s now been, would not continue to cause adverse effects like this.  I used traz 3 years nightly (50 mg with a few weeks increased dose to 75 mg).  

I presume you never cycled off your supplements, throw in this or that to experiment to get the effects you looking for, etc.  Supplements, nootropics, herbs, amino acids, fatty acids, especially in stacks are not what I call benign.  They all have powerful effects, if you add them on top of scripts you may be taking it becomes more complicated.  There’s tolerance, cross tolerance even something called tachyphilaxis, there’s also something called paradoxical reactions.  Desensitization of brains receptors and neurotransmitters is a real thing.  

With that of information, where you go from this point you’ll have to decide."
9016,h81illh,,,insomnia,1628332135,"Yes.

I have several sleep disorders.


Take medication for them."
9017,h81iiyi,,,insomnia,1628332071,"Shit, i took 20mgs of ambien at 11pm and now it's 6:30am and I haven't even been to sleep yet. Who needs sleep anyways?

Jk, insomnias fucking awful and has truly ruined my life since it got really severe last year and I ended up having whst the Drs called a ""insomnia invoked seizure"", which I didn't even know you could have a seizure from insomnia.

Also, thanks to the seizures I had back in July I can't drive until December, so when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it did...so that's cool you know."
9018,h81iapa,,,insomnia,1628331872,One of my prof. once suggested to start reading a book and slowly you'll feel sleepy. Didn't find it much helpful. But your tip of changing the place is interesting and will definitely try this. Thanks!

9028,h81dxsc,,,insomnia,1628327955,"Insomnia can be caused by a number of other factors, correct? This is why we have sleep studies, and why doctors ask questions and evaluate you. Is it due to depression? Anxiety? Sleep apnea? Hyper-arousal?  Some other malady? 

Some things are not always obvious to the sufferer. 

It isn't as simple as ""You have insomnia, here, take these medications."" 

Again, temporary solution until we figure out the issue. On that, I would not disagree with medications."

9030,h81cv47,,,insomnia,1628326986,"If you can, try to listen to your breathing. Listen to it as if you're engaged in a conversation with a friend. Try to give it your full attention. If you cannot hear your breathing, do not breathe louder, listen closer or lip-read. If that is to difficult, take nice deep breaths and slowly, in a low tone, hum. Listen to your hum. 

If random thoughts start to appear, that's fine. But try your best to not engage and let them fade away. 

This takes effort, but hopefully the effort will make you tired even if you can't get comfortable in bed.

I’ve probably averaged an hour a night this week. It absolutely sucks. I don’t know the answer other then try prescription meds. Im waiting on my appointment. I work in a few hours and just wanna quit. Financially I can’t. Pounding headache but I will push through someway or another. 

I feel for you. What helps me is knowing you’re not alone and it’s not gonna kill you. 1 hour of sleep is something. Push through the day and pray it gets better.

9059,h812ykw,,,insomnia,1628318470,I can confirm quetiapine is great for a sleep aid but it’s not good to be prescribed for that and that only. Otherwise temazepam is quite a weak benzodiazepine that is really not that hard to come off of. I’ve been on and off it when times got tough like you’ve stated and has worked every time.
9060,h812elr,,,insomnia,1628318035,"I wasn't taking a precise amount of magnesium, I just ate food that I knew it was rich in magnesium, no pills or other stuff. Getting some sunlight during daytime would actually help me as well. Also try not to drink any form of caffeine and cut from nicotine if you're a smoker. You will be better don't worry."
9061,h812ebh,,,insomnia,1628318029,Yeah but ask your psychiatrist. I know that situation and the will to try anything that helps...

It really helped me on my psychosis"
9065,h810xtj,,,insomnia,1628316923,"A trick I employ is to stop caring about when you sleep. If I want to watch a few more videos or read an article before bed, then I'll stay up even if it's late. But be careful not to form bad habits. By dropping any anxiety associated with sleep, you'll sleep better. As you said, it's not an issue about quantity for you it's about the QUALITY of your sleep.

You might lose a few hours of sleep at most, but that's good anyway for ""sleep restriction"". I'm sure you're already aware, but you should also ensure that your sleep hygiene is very good."
9066,h810mze,,,insomnia,1628316693,"Definitely insomnia. I would recommend removing sources of stress in your life as much as you temporarily can to fix your sleep. Take everything at your own pace and make sure to maximise your sleep hygiene. If you feel restless, try exercising at least 3 hours before sleeping. You might have misophonia (from the irritation to sound), but I'll need more information to claim that.

Sleep restriction is probably the best thing here, since you actually feel sleepy too. But like I said, remove all your sources of stress like trying to minimise the light from your doorstep."
9067,h810e6b,,,insomnia,1628316508,"Thank you, I did get a good sleep! I hope your days get better too. Stay well. :)"

9078,h80rkzm,,,insomnia,1628310510,Properly diagnosed? Surely you already know that you have insomnia. The only question is to decide if you are willing to live a life with in or do something that actually works to manage it.
9079,h80rcwo,,,insomnia,1628310374,"thanks. i’m sorry if i come across as ignorant or rude, i’m just very frustrated. In your personal opinion/experience, do you think it’d make any sense to still be feeling the side effects of the trazodone (due to effect it may have had on my brain chemistry)? Would it be possible that more time is needed for my body to just reach homeostasis again or balanced energy levels?"

Things only became problematic/started going downhill when i started these doc prescribed sleep meds. It’s been almost a full month since i stopped the trazodone too &amp; i still feel like my energy levels are not what they were. I know what i’m feeling is legitimate &amp; that trazodone played a part. Even caffeine &amp; adderall don’t help. The feeling they gave pre-trazodone was far more pronounced. And i know people are gonna bring up “tolerance” next, but AGAIN, please trust me when i say, there’s a different between tolerance &amp; what i’m experiencing. Not to
mention, things didn’t change in me since beginning the trazodone. I just want to know if anyone else taking trazodone, particularly with adderall or ritalin has experienced something similar. I need hope, this is so painfully frustrating :/"

9099,h80e8by,,,insomnia,1628302973,"It hasn't really resolved. It periodically comes and goes. I started a job last month that's physically really draining and takes up half my day including transportation etc. So as usually I'm able to sleep as soon as I close my eyes, but I still have a problem with waking up randomly in the middle of the night. 
But of course I know being tired won't help you sleep every night, I've been there before. If my insomnia continues I will probably seek medical help at some point. Unfortunately I don't think I can help you further since from what I've gathered different people require different things."

I was t even read to as a child. I had no books. Books were a waste of $ and 6 years of grace school poor grades and parents not helping me with homework made me numb. Luckily I have a high IQ , fantastic memory and at 43 zero emotions. I spent 25-37yo with gfs..live in, fiancé’s and no one now for 6 years. Plus I cheated always because I got lucky and am very attractive and my adhd led me to lifting weights at 13yo and a decade as a personal trainer ducking anything that moved. Especially married older womAn who were my sugar mommas. I used to full nights with sex or drugs now I am depressed during day and happy alone at night….need 8mg klonopin, 20mg melatonin and weed to fall asleep.  And think about my biological parents 24/7.  And think I’m a sociopath from my life…I have no clue where I was the 1st 6 months of my life. My adoptive parents  don’t either.?

9125,h805q2d,,,insomnia,1628298359,"the thing with prescriptions/supplements is that I live in a country where.... everything other than melatonin is either illegal for very challenging to get. you can get their version of ambien but a lot of people in my family are addicted to that and it kind of gives me the creeps. 

its a good list and thank you for putting it together. I have been looking on the local internet. 

There is valerian here, how do you find that it compares melatonin?"
9126,h805i06,,,insomnia,1628298248,"Yup, if I can't fall asleep again after 15 min, I leave my bed and go elsewhere and do a relaxing activity in dim lighting (eg, reading, sometimes watching a boring show) till I feel sleepy and go back to bed."
9127,h8056bh,,,insomnia,1628298082,"I had the exact same issue.  At my last checkup I told my doc and he prescribed atenelol. It's been terrific for me!  Just a caution though, I've only been on it for 6 weeks.  But I was truly shocked by how much of a difference it made."

9134,h801d8b,,,insomnia,1628295943,"Yeah, insomnia is tough. There can be a number of things you can do to help yourself. Don’t exercise too late in the day, avoid blue light or any stimulating light at night and be as cool as possible when getting ready for bed. Obviously sleep hygiene is the common refrain from experts. 

When insomnia is light I personally take a super hot shower, and watch a little ASMR or read a book. Some nights are harder than others. If my anxiety is bad then it makes sleeping really difficult. At this point I usually start taking meds because I know I need to. For me, sleep meditations didn’t help either, they almost made me more alert."

9140,h7zy9dd,,,insomnia,1628294251,"Yeah this can be normal, if you slept for 5 hours during the it's not really a nap, that's a proper sleep. So it's not surprising you woke up confused as body clock would be out of sync, it's happened similar to me if I sleep for too long during the day."
9141,h7zu5z0,,,insomnia,1628292161,"I was in your shoes like 2 years ago, I would have always talked to my ex girlfriend about my sleep issues and then feeling guilty, and miserable because I couldn't sleep. There are many reasons that can keep us awake at night, from anxiety, family problems to medical issues and if we can find it then it's solvable. From my personal experience, I had a very bad anxiety about sleep when my insomnia started to show up, I would feel anxious everytime I had to reach the bed. What helped me pretty much was magnesium because I found out that it takes an important role in our sleep quality so I was trying to eat only food rich in magnesium and my insomnia would start to go off (from 0 hours of sleep to roughly 3-4). With little progresses my insomnia would be very mild and I was eventually able to sleep 5-6 hours per night even though I would still have some bad nights but not like before. You can try to eat food that contains magnesium because it calms you down, reduce anxiety and improves your sleep. If you have medical issues insomnia can be a symptom of it, pills can also have insomnia as side effect from them so watch out for everything you take. Don't freak out, everything will be fine and nothing bad will happen, if you are only thinking about your sleep issues then you are just making things worse in your mind."

Therapy sounds the the best option for you.

Exhaustion/insomnia/loud ringing in ears/heart palpitations. One thing that I do that can help me a tiny, tiny little bit is: I place my hand over my chest and gently breathe into my lower tummy. Calms me a little."
9156,h7zkf19,,,insomnia,1628287447,"Yeah sometimes this can help, I usually just go sit in the lounge in the dark, no phone though as that can stimulate the brain. If the weather is good sometimes go sit outside in the garden at like 4am in the summer for about half hour to cool down."

Anything else you can suggest as well?"
9166,h7z9wiz,,,insomnia,1628282702,"It's not just rare it's virtually non existent, about 40 families worldwide have it. It's a prion disease, like CJD. 

Insomnia cannot kill indirectly in a medical sense, the body and brain finally shuts down and gets sleep. Yes there was a guy who was unable to sleep and did die but insomnia was not the cause, if I remember correctly he had nerve, spinal damage etc and was unable to sleep. 

 It can kill indirectly if you were for example to drive after 3 or 4 days of no sleep and have an accident."

9171,h7z7nou,,,insomnia,1628281700,Do it
9172,h7z7lub,,,insomnia,1628281677,So how did it resolve ?
9173,h7z72e7,,,insomnia,1628281436,"""Sure it's rare"" less than 100 people have it lmao, and it's limited to a handful of families in Italy and Spain. Rare is putting it lightly. Its possible someone here might have it, but its likely they already would know they have it, and that they aren't an American teen who just hasn't slept well for a couple months.

""Insomnia can kill indirectly"" you can't die from insomnia. That is a scientific fact. Sure people can die from other things, such as a disease that is causing issues masquerading themselves as insomnia, or from suicide, but insomnia itself is not fatal. 

""Idk if this is a good message to tell people"" Telling people to not claim they have a disease they don't is a BAD message? Ok /sarcasm"
9174,h7z6v6e,,,insomnia,1628281347,im going to see an md who has helped diagnose me with another condition soon :) hopefully they’ll be able to help me properly decide what works for me !

9177,h7z57u3,,,insomnia,1628280613,"Yes, I have zero side-effects from zopiclone, too.

If it really was working as a placebo for you, then that's actually good news. It means that you don't really need any medication to sleep."
9178,h7z4dda,,,insomnia,1628280241,How?
9179,h7z43qk,,,insomnia,1628280124,Being reliant on a sleeping medication that allows you to get your healing and necessary sleep is far more important than being reliant on a medication. We are reliant on many things in life. You have to do what you need to do to take care of your health. Why choose a shorter life of misery and frustration and lost opportunities?
9180,h7z21if,,,insomnia,1628279224,I wouldn't become too concerned unless it becomes severe or chronic.
9181,h7z1i5x,,,insomnia,1628278993,It's simply time to switch to a different prescription sleep medication. There are so many effective ones. Talk with your doctor about trying a new one and start feeling good again!
9182,h7z0nfx,,,insomnia,1628278617,"Be great if it turned out that way. I had no side effects from it either, so I can get up and work out no sweat. 

I’m just worried that it may have stopped working long ago and I thought it was working. Like a placebo effect."
9183,h7z0kmk,,,insomnia,1628278581,"Melatonin is NOT a sleeping pill. Talk to your doctor about finding a real sleeping pill, the one that will be effective for you."
9184,h7z02q2,,,insomnia,1628278362,"It's a bit too early to tell if you have tolerance to it. Even if you do, that's a pretty good run of 7-8 months non-stop. If you take a month off to get rid of the tolerance, then you might be able to do another 7-8 months. One month off, out of every eight, isn't bad!"
9185,h7z02jk,,,insomnia,1628278360,"Unfortunately I live in the UK and doctors hardly ever give out benzo's or Z-drugs even for insomnia. I have also been treated for depression and told them of my drug abuse so there's absolutely no chance. I have to buy from the darknet. Thank you for taking the time to give advice though.

Ambien scares me from the stories I've heard. Klonopin did work eventually last night but at 4mg, which I hear is a lot, plus I took a lot of other stuff. It's frustrating because Klonopin definitely works but I'm scared of developing a benzo addiction. Maybe I should just take it every night to prevent withdrawals. I despise working and am happily unemployed at the moment but having to buy benzo's could be a way of motivating myself to enjoy working my ass off my whole life"
9186,h7z00rp,,,insomnia,1628278337,There are lots of prescription medications available for insomnia. Talk with your doctor and start feeling well again!
9187,h7yz29t,,,insomnia,1628277913,I hope it helps you!

9189,h7yyrx6,,,insomnia,1628277787,You're welcome! I really hope it helps you
9190,h7yyknc,,,insomnia,1628277699,"I just woke up at 8pm and feel like total shit. But hey at least I slept. Felt like a scarily deep sleep though. I was stupid but desperate. Thanks for your comment, I will look into CBT sleep training"
9191,h7yy72g,,,insomnia,1628277537,"Yeah I’m the same way. Is it possible your circadian rhythm is off? Like if society didn’t exist, what time would you naturally go to bed? For me it’s like 4am. I don’t naturally get tired until very very late, even if I woke up at 5am. 

The only thing that has ever worked in my experience is melatonin (in much larger doses than people recommend. Talking like 20mg), that sleep aid shit that basically is NyQuil without all the other ingredients, and benzos. But none of those are good for long term, except maybe melatonin. Other than that, the best thing you can do is sleep hygiene. 

Turn off all screens at least 1 hour before getting into bed. Try to make sure your lighting is dim after about dinner time. Don’t drink sugar or caffeine after like 5pm, or ever if possible. Any blue light filters you have, turn them off pretty much all the time. Make your room completely dark. Blackout curtains are cheep. Stuff a towel under your door to block that light out. Get a box fan and turn it on. It helps in 2 ways. 

1st way is the white noise. Second way is your body falls asleep much easier when it is cold. 

Last piece of advice would be maybe to take a warm bath/shower an hour or two before bed? Also try reading a book. Not an ebook, but a book book. Reading makes me tired. Other than that, you can’t really fix too much else. Consider if maybe your lack of sleep stems from anxiety, or anxiety about “oh I have to be up in 6 hours and 24 minutes! Fuck!” That’s what happens to me. Try the 4-7-8 breathing method too until you get sleepy in bed. Best of luck man. A lot of people experience what you are."
9192,h7yy6tw,,,insomnia,1628277534,"The only thing that could possibly help someone to sleep is the Klonopin. I'm not familiar with Ezizolam. However, if the Klonopin is not working it just simply means it's not the specific sleep med that is effective for you. Talk to your doctor about trying something like Ambien which is designed for sleep. Sleeping medications are hit or miss until you find the one(s) that are the most effective for you. Work with your doctor and get relief."
9193,h7yx43w,,,insomnia,1628277070,I’m 18 and as I can recall... 13? Around 6-7th grade.
9194,h7yx1u0,,,insomnia,1628277043,"Sure it's rare, but there's a bunch of people in this sub, some probably do have it. Also insomnia can kill indirectly. Idk if this is a good message to tell people"
9195,h7ywtfx,,,insomnia,1628276942,"Damn! I'm sorry to hear that. I'm definitely faring better than yourself, so I hope you get some rest soon!   


I should really try to get my ass moving, it's nearly sunset LOL"

9197,h7yw2ts,,,insomnia,1628276626,"Indicas are designed to help you sleep better. I highly recommend you try it. Getting a good night's sleep, on a regular basis, has vastly improved my life in so many ways."
9198,h7yw0du,,,insomnia,1628276598,"If you drink alcohol in the hours before bedtime, this could be your body ""snapping to attention"" when it finishes metabolizing the alcohol.

Another possibility is that you have to use the bathroom, but it's a subtle feeling (you might not even feel the need to urinate), and you can't quite get comfortable enough to fall back asleep. This was happening to me for ages (years?) and when I finally started forcing myself out of bed to go to the bathroom, I found I was able to fall back sleep much more easily. Previously, I would roll around for hours and hours, sometimes never really getting back to bed. I never thought it was something as simple as needing to pee, but it really did turn out to be a big factor."
9199,h7yv6tl,,,insomnia,1628276245,Uhoh. Did not know fatal insomnia existed. New fear unlocked.
9200,h7yv15p,,,insomnia,1628276177,"When are you trying to fall asleep? I take 25mg of Seroquel nightly, and only take it about 30-45 mins before sleeping -- any longer and it doesn't really do it for me. I imagine you may be taking more than 25mg, so your experience may be radically different than mine (I only take it  ""off-label"" for insomnia)."
9201,h7yulnc,,,insomnia,1628275992,"To my understanding, there is no proven “cure” for insomnia; different things work for different people. I personally liked MM after using sleeping pills, because sleeping pills always made me groggy in the morning to the point where I could barely wake up some days, so MM was a solution that worked for me"
9202,h7yuik1,,,insomnia,1628275955,"This is huge -- I get way more anxious energy when I snack a bunch before sleeping. I seem to have a hiatal hernia which ""acts up"" if I overeat, especially before sleeping. I think my stomach pushing up gives my lungs less room to breathe and my heart less room to pump, and everything feels ""off"" and not very comfortable. Definitely makes sleeping more difficult."
9203,h7yua5k,,,insomnia,1628275855,"I can't have caffeine after about 11:30am to noonish, and that's if I want to try to sleep by 1am. Try to limit it to first thing in the morning, and then stay away after noon! Some people are much more sensitive than others.

You also might be having an anxiety attack of sorts. Consider if anything is setting you off, what may have changed that's causing this, and can you make tweaks to your life that might help bring down anxiety?

Be aware, not all anxiety is negative -- you could be excited in a positive way about a new job, new relationship, new interest, etc. But it can sure still keep you up!"
9204,h7yu2vg,,,insomnia,1628275768,"I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. I have similar issues except my heart wants to race when first falling asleep and I keep getting startled at nothing. I usually do breathing exercises to calm my heart down. My tinnitus hasn’t been as bad lately since I started only taking my sleep med every other night and I have a feeling it was caused by the meds.

Are you able to have a white noise generator in the background to distract yourself from the ear ringing? I use a fan with different speeds. I also used to play tinnitus relieving videos on YouTube and that helped me sleep when the ringing is louder at night.

Also need to go back to doing cardio again. It helped with my palpitations."
9205,h7yttc1,,,insomnia,1628275655,"I find it helps. :) Also helps ""take the edge off"" on those days I haven't slept the night before."
9206,h7ytt4w,,,insomnia,1628275653,"I’ve been using it on and off for the past 6 years, but the last 7-8 months, yea, it’s been a every night thing. Just seemed to work really well because I didn’t have to worry about sleep anymore, giving me more peace of mind in the day, therefore increasing my quality of life. 

My psychiatrist said some people do stay on it long term and it works well for them. I was hoping I’d be one of those people but I guess not. 

I went to the ER this morning and they gave me sublinox till I see my doctor so I’m hoping that works out better."
9207,h7yto2y,,,insomnia,1628275593,I take it and still can’t sleep.
9208,h7yti60,,,insomnia,1628275523,"I've had pretty intense chronic insomnia for 15+ years now, but it can definitely be negatively affected by distressing/anxiety-inducing interpersonal relationships.

I had one of the worst flare-ups ever from late 2020 through early 2021, and it only got better when I quit my job. I'm buddies with the guy who runs the company who was my boss, but I realized there was an interpersonal issue when it came to working for the guy directly, and it was causing me an intense amount of stress.

My sleeping got much better when I left the job. I attribute 80% of my challenge to the nature of my relationship with my boss, vs. the job itself. And again, I like the guy -- but got to know him better when I was working for him directly, and realized we're just not compatible in that kind of relationship."
9209,h7ysqwx,,,insomnia,1628275203,"Did you take zopiclone every night for the past 7-8 months? If so, perhaps you have developed a tolerance. In that case, quit taking it for month, to get rid of the tolerance. During the month off, use something like Benadryl if you need something to help you sleep (which you probably will).

IIRC, studies show that not much tolerance or dependence happens if you use it for only 28 days in a row. That was the length of the study, so I have no idea how long it takes to normally develop dependence. Obviously, some people can develop it very quickly, but others never develop it."
9210,h7yrjyy,,,insomnia,1628274694,"It depends on the person, everyone is different, has different tolerance levels etc. Also depends on the drugs, Benzo's for example if used every night will build tolerance and they also have cross tolerance so will eventually stop working at therapeutic doses."
9211,h7ypqye,,,insomnia,1628273919,"I drink coffee just in the morning, but Arabica which contains less than half content of caffeine. Cutting caffeine gives just some dowsiness for few days... In the morning you can make a walk o some in house gym to wake up your body. Take care of your self, and make changes slowly, don't push too hard"
9212,h7ypao2,,,insomnia,1628273722,Richard Siagian right? i feel so bad for him :( but then again his case was very unusual. But for people with just insomnia you would fall asleep before reaching a dangerous point so i don’t think insomniacs should worry much about dying it can make the insomnia worse
9213,h7ymwcx,,,insomnia,1628272681,What do you do to prevent the drowsiness that’s usually fixed by caffeine?
9214,h7ymnbz,,,insomnia,1628272576,Lol..
9215,h7ym43h,,,insomnia,1628272350,"Good question.  I honestly think working out. I’m on a really bad streak of an hour of sleep a day for five days and while rest does help, working out is better to give your better the drive to go into deeper sleep"
9216,h7ylpqf,,,insomnia,1628272182,"I think you do have insomnia
I've suffered with insomnia for about 3 years now and it fucking sucks. It got really bad during quarantine. I used to lay in my bed for hours and hours and I couldn't sleep because of my heartbeat. I felt that with every beat my entire bed was shaking. The worst thing I can remember is last year when I got a job, I went on my first day without sleeping a wink, powered through an 9 hour shift and I thought I would sleep really early at night. I was totally exhausted and when I laid down I just couldn't fucking sleep, but when I was up I was dizzy and exhausted and I started crying. I drank tea and hot milk and tried everything but nothing worked. 
So you're definitely not alone in this and insomnia really sucks"
9217,h7yjyc0,,,insomnia,1628271445,"Zopiclone actually helped me quite abit with my anxiety, because that’s where most of my anxiety comes from; sleep issues. It would just relax me and shut off my brain, then boom sleep lol.

But I could easily wake up the next morning and feel great. It was like a miracle in a little blue pill. Now my brain is going to assume it’ll never work anymore because stupid brain gotta be stupid 🙄"
9218,h7yjc31,,,insomnia,1628271186,"Yeah, they gave me antidepressents and in 9 days only it fcked my libido and  emotions"

9224,h7y9unq,,,insomnia,1628267214,Yesss. A lot of my insomnia stems from anxiety and not being able to stop thinking. That is a very popular way for insomnia to occur. Meditation and mindfulness is what helps me with that.

I’m on meds for BPD/ADD/insomnia and I take my ambien 10mg around 11:30pm and fall asleep around 12:00am but I can’t sleep past 5am every single miserable day. The first week on Ambien 5mg was great I was sleeping 8hrs or 9 but then the next week I was waking up at 3am sometimes 4am so what I would do is take a 5mg ambien wake up 3hrs later and take another 5mg but it didn’t work. I was moved to 10mg but that doesn’t do shit either. I don’t know what else to do to get some goddamn sleep? Anyways..

9232,h7y6ppo,,,insomnia,1628265888,"Should be clear that your meds aren't working, likely because they're not treating the true underlying basis for the sleep disruption.  Talk to your doc, and if nothing medically identifiable, ask if using a CBT sleep training system might be appropriate.  Substance free, and for most a permanent solution."
9233,h7y6jcy,,,insomnia,1628265815,"That worry is a potent fuel for insomnia.  Be sure to discuss this with your therapist, and ask if using a CBT sleep training system might be appropriate.  That gives you tools to battle back the worry."
9234,h7y6f35,,,insomnia,1628265765,"Appears the melatonin isn't working, which isn't surprising because it's ineffective for chronic insomnia.  Need to get to the root issues and treat those.  Start with your doc, and if nothing medical try a CBT sleep training system."
9235,h7y6aml,,,insomnia,1628265711,"Working shifts is just tough with no easy answers.  Sounds like you're mostly doing the right sorts of things, esp important is as much consistency as possible with sleep-wake.  With some jobs that might be near impossible."
9236,h7y66gn,,,insomnia,1628265663,"Can you get CBD in the UK? I’ve tried a combination CBD/melatonin gummies and they have helped make me tired.

Why is the UK so against legalizing marijuana?"
9237,h7y5zie,,,insomnia,1628265584,"The message should be loud and clear -- all those substances aren't working, likely because they're not treating the underlying cause.

Can't tell from just this what might be going on, but the usual causes for primary insomnia are some combo of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about sleep.  You may have both going on.  Standard of care for that is use of a CBT sleep training system."
9238,h7y5qms,,,insomnia,1628265481,"Yes, likely the changes did trigger some added stress and conditioned negative responses from your past experience.  These sorts of things tend to be short lived however, esp if we make an effort to let go the worry about sleep.  And use healthy sleep supportive habits such as good daily exercise and a relaxing wind down period before bed."
9239,h7y539u,,,insomnia,1628265207,"What helped me is to reduce stress, 20 mins of daily high intense exercise and not overeating.

My psychiatrist prescribed me 75mg of seroquil and I take 1.25 of melatonin a night. It’s just generally better. Also, my anti-depressant keeps me from wanting to sleep too much during the day which helps me sleep at night. 

Seriously I went to four sleep doctors and none of them helped me."
9245,h7xz2zl,,,insomnia,1628262665,"Yes, thank you, that is what I was meaning. Taking a warm shower an hour or so before bed to help lower internal temperature"
9246,h7xyg1v,,,insomnia,1628262387,"Definitely try another GP. However some GP practices now have a policy to not prescribe them due to abuse. When I moved areas a few years ago and requested my usual prescription the doctor called to say they have a policy not to prescribe them. And they would need to discuss alternatives. 

 I politely pointed out this treatment plan was put in place by an NHS psychiatrist and for them to check my notes. They ended up agreeing to prescribe them,  so going through your trusts mental health team might be best."
9247,h7xx55x,,,insomnia,1628261830,"Tbh they might be doing you a favour,  mitazaprine starts off being ridiculously effective at helping you sleep, but you build up a dependency and then the  effectiveness drops off a clip, and also the withdrawal effects are crazy,  gives you so much anxiety you feel like you're in a horror movie."
9248,h7xwrvz,,,insomnia,1628261671,Antidepressants can cause insomnia.  It is a side effect listed in the manufacturer’s literature and GPS know this.  Amitriptyline is another antidepressant with heavy sedating side effects.  The withdrawal from its use are not pleasant and require tapering to minimize withdrawal ramifications.  The pharmacist may have recommendations for over the counter meds to help.
9249,h7xw41m,,,insomnia,1628261391,"Do a blinded randomized test, to see if the zopiclone has any real effect.

You probably shouldn't stop taking it cold-turkey, or you could have some really bad sleeps for awhile. But I agree with Neil, that taking a break for a month or so might help to restore any tolerance that has built up.

I've been taking zopiclone for many years, and I don't think I've developed much tolerance or dependence. However, I only take it about 50% of the time, and seldom for more than a week or two without a break for at least a few days. It might be those breaks that prevent the tolerance from developing.

In any case, I wouldn't be too concerned if it's only stopped working well for 2 or 3 nights. It could be anxiety that is adding to your insomnia. Zopiclone doesn't really help with anxiety."
9250,h7xvpk0,,,insomnia,1628261227,"Forgot to mention, out of all of these solutions, ramelteon probably has the highest success rate with the least amount of side effects, and I was able to find ramelteon very close to me for $35 out of pocket with the single care app. Its an app that helps you find deals for prescriptions, it saves you a ridiculous amount of money. Ramelteon is like a more powerful effective version of melatonin"
9251,h7xv0jn,,,insomnia,1628260937,i wander where the wind takes me.
9252,h7xu3dr,,,insomnia,1628260541,"Honestly, it’s not for everyone but I use 2m2b. It’s a tertiary alcohol and primitive surgical anesthetic from the days when they used chloroform. It tastes disgusting but it works really well. I put it into capsule with a tincture squirter, but they melt quickly. You just have to be very careful with it, because it has withdrawal similar to alcohol when used more than 2-3x a week, but so does ambien.

You could go the natural route. L-theanine and melatonin aren’t the most effective, but they can’t hurt, so you may as well take them, just keep the melatonin to 1mg ideally. There’s valerian and skullcap which are proven to have no withdrawal/dependence, there’s mulungu, there’s kava, even kratom will work, but kratom is a mild opioid so its a last resort. Folk medicine healers have been using low doses of amanita muscaria (feels sedative like alcohol at low doses)as well as cannabis preparations for thousands of years for sleep. Currently there is a legal substance very close to THC called delta-8-THC. Its the same exact thing except it’s legal in most places because it comes from hemp. It has the same legal status as CBD but feels exactly the same as regular THC.

Then you could always try phenibut, but that’s a russian anti-anxiety drug from the 30’s which is sold as a supplement. It’s another heavy GABAergic like benzos or ambien. It works very well, the only downside to that is it takes 2 hours to kick in and should be taken on an empty stomach.

There are OTC options like unisom, but they’re anticholinergics which are associated with dementia when used regularly, plus they dont play well with my RLS symptoms.

There are some other perscription sleep aids which aren’t addictive like ramelteon and belsomra, which are better than most of what they offer."
9253,h7xt8vh,,,insomnia,1628260178,Valerian and skullcap are both proven to have no dependence or withdrawal so you’re safe. Feel free to look into it yourself
9254,h7xsg4w,,,insomnia,1628259828,"Are you ever able to get back to sleep? Like do you sleep in two short sessions instead of one with a break in the middle?

Breaks in sleeps aren’t actually that uncommon and a long time ago, it was considered normal. People would go to bed when it got dark, wake up in the middle of the night for an hour or two, maybe eat, then go back to bed until morning. Sleeping a full 8 hours at once is actually a modern idea. Not conforming to this doesn’t automatically mean you have insomnia, but are merely struggling with the societal expectations you think you should meet.

Are you tired? Do you feel unrested? Do you feel lethargic or slow in the mind? Those are the more important questions to ask yourself. If you’re waking and you are alert and feel rested, you’re fine. If you feel like it’s a negative aspect in your life, if you feel like it drains you, then I would seek more professional help."

9329,h7wpeyt,,,insomnia,1628233198,"Yeah GP's in the UK very rarely prescribe benzo's, unlike in the US from what I've heard, but that's probably a good thing.

I find that Nytol One A Night works quite well, although often I have to take two or three. It's an antihistamine you ask for at the pharmacy counter. 

I recently got prescribed Phenergan for insomnia. It's also an antihistamine but a step up from Nytol as I find it puts me to sleep easier. The downside to Phenergan is that it has a very long half-life so it stays in your system a long time and can make it hard to get yourself up the next day. This is worse if like me you have depression as it's hard enough drag myself out of bed as it is.

Another option is Mirtazapine. I got prescribed this for depression but as well as being an anti-depressant it is also a very good sleep aid. Usually knocks me out pretty easily but similar to Phenergan it makes me feel really groggy the next day and very hard to get out of bed. So bad that I'd spend all of the next day in bed and so the good sleep wasn't worth it. Also important to note that, strangely, lower doses are better for sleep with this one. 

So yeah I don't really have an answer for you as I'm also still searching for that magic pill. I hear good things about melatonin, which I think has to be prescribed here in the UK for some weird reason, so that's the next one I'll request from my GP.

Try melatonin? Try drinking a warm cup of Horlicks before bed. Try really hard not to use your phone when you wake in the night. Don’t drink alcohol.

I would deem regular insomnia as something that can be easily addressed with melatonin and sleep hygiene. Bouts of resurfacing insomnia and restless nights from anxiety and external factors.

If you haven't slept for 5 days in a row, that's just normal insomnia? There aren't really enough ways to measure the degree of severity in insomniacs."

Benzo gets our mind vague and irritated also it causes dementia so I wouldn’t recommend it.
Don’t do anything to get sleepy at night because all your try would be just in vain. You can’t fall asleep without pills anyway. And that would get you annoyed and irritated more. Just leave your sleeping schedule messed up as it goes. I think that is the healthiest solution to insomnia.
We are sick so it’s unfortunately inevitable to take some disadvantages.

I've been taking them for years and I usually have occasional bouts of insomnia but sleep good more than not.

It's just this year has been the worst for me. I'm not sure if it's an underlying condition but last week, my sleep improved so that leads me to believe it could be anxiety that is causing it. my anxiety does seem to go up the longer it takes for me to fall asleep. I'll think things like ""why am i still up? this isn't good."" A medical opinion is good advice but I'm uninsured and it would cost me a lot of money possibly.

If there are sleep aids that help with anxiety available OTC, that might be a solution as well? It's possible the Benedryls don't really work for me but I fell asleep taking them last week so I'm not sure. It's a very confusing situation. 

I would say anxiety is likely the cause but I'd hope for a at home fix to it because doctors visits could get expensive for me. Not to mention covid is bad here in FL so I could get sick just by going to the doctors. Not an easy situation sadly."

If the answer to these are true, tolerance is occurring.  Tolerance means you need more of the mefucatiin to get the same results.  You’ll have to determine if this is plausible, if you have an underlying issue like something physical/medical, if your sleep is possible psychiatric as in fairly high anxiety especially centered around sleep.

You also have another nonmed issue, that being your seriously messed up sleep schedule that's wreaking havoc with your body clock.  That's something within your control.

You might be able to comprehensively address this, both med and nonmed issues, by using a CBT sleep training system in conjunction with your meds.  Ask your doc if that'd be appropriate."

9428,h7tohue,,,insomnia,1628180515,"So, I had my first bout with insomnia since I was a kid last winter and it STRESSED me out. It was like a switch was fliped and I went from someone who could sleep 8 hours with no issue to sleeping 3 or 4 hours a night in fits and starts. Each day, I  would get so anxious that I wouldn't sleep that night that I could barely concentrate on anything else. I read a bajillion things about what causes insomnia and what to do about it and most of it was not helpful at all. However, I did start watching videos from the sleep coach school which is run by a sleep physician and he said that insomnia is caused by anxiety that we build up around sleep. It's like a fight or flight response that is triggered when we connect not sleeping with a threat. The way to untangle this is to just come to terms with not sleeping. Watch TV, read a book go do like anything else to distract yourself from your stresses about not sleeping and eventually your brain no longer identifies being a awake as a threat and then you fall asleep. He has an app called bedtyme which will take you through this whole model and he will answer your questions about your insomnia journey. This whole method really worked for me. I still have some nights where I have issues sleeping  but my insomnia is essentially gone."

I have not slept in years- and have been given many sleep meds- they might work for a few hours and then they stop.

I can also understand why some in your household perceive you to be asleep when only you know you are vigilant all night. 
I do not think you are being dramatic or are a hypochondriac.  You are miserable.  I wish that there were some single solution.   If there is a fatal insomnia, I don’t know what the fatality is.   But I do know that I have developed extreme panic , and GI issues, severe pain snd even cancer - yes cancer- all related to a weakened immune system that lack of sleep

Try all the conservative approaches, and if you have the energy - talk to a doctor about this lengthy period without sleep and see what is recommended.  I totally empathize with you.  It sets the world upside down.  People need to believe you - I get no support -hoping you can find some."

9435,h7tlbzv,,,insomnia,1628179214,"I saw 6 endocrinologists, 1 internist, just for starters. But that doesn’t mean I can ever recommend this for anyone. I’m very sorry you are not feeling well. I’m still learning more about my health. And it’s not just hyperthyroidism I have. It required/still requiring me extreme work and constant research on my part. After 19 doctors ( nineteen), I am just starting to get some answers. I am not even close to being a little bit better. I’m fully debilitated."
9436,h7tjt6v,,,insomnia,1628178584,"It’s not really clear how or why it develops from my understanding. Some people develop symptoms after one use. When I first started latuda I had uncontrollable face movements a couple times, but fortunately it wasn’t permanent, but in some cases it is, and the longer you use it the more likely it is to happen. I’m not comfortable taking something that has the possibility to do that to me, not for my mood and definitely not for my sleep, especially if there are other, FDA approved options out there.  My buddy has been prescribed an antipsychotic for intrusive thoughts and recently got back lab results with a low white blood cell count and an even lower red blood cell count which is also a common side effect of antipsychotics. IMO they are way over prescribed considering their risks"

9453,h7tbjvi,,,insomnia,1628175080,"Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine, not a sleeping medication. However, doctors like to prescribe stuff like that first, because it can't be abused, isn't addictive, and can work for sleep in some people.

After that, they'll probably try something like trazadone. Again, not a sleeping med, but it can sometimes work.

If that doesn't work, then you might be prescribed a real sleeping med, probably a z-drug like Ambien or Lunesta.

Point is, get used to trying a few things before you find one that works."

9459,h7t6wvz,,,insomnia,1628173459,"Trazadone is an antidepressant that sometimes makes some people drowsy. A friend had given me a couple. The first night I slept so well. I was even still drowsy in the morning, imagine that. After that one time, nothing. I guess it works for some people. Even legitimate sleeping pills don’t help me sleep though. Lifelong problem."

I have other anxiety disorders and this one has been super tricky for me with the loss of motivation and massive increases in anxiety. Hopefully, we'll find relief soon."
9461,h7t40ya,,,insomnia,1628172800,Have tried Seroquel. Unfortunately didn’t work for me. Thanks for the suggestion I’ll check it out
9462,h7t3ydp,,,insomnia,1628172784,"In my experience a lot of the sleep hygiene stuff doesn’t help that much, and can actually make me more stressed. What does help is if I feel more relaxed in the evenings, which is not an easy task if you suffer from anxiety like I do. Once the sun goes down, I don’t try to do anything except activities that make me feel more relaxed and happy. That could even include tv or a movie (on a dim yellow screen if possible!) The benefit of being relaxed far outweighs the negative effect of blue light IME. Whatever helps. Listen to a podcast, gentle stretching, listening to music, a bath, reading. The work for me is in trying to be self compassionate and allow myself to relinquish the day, to let it go. And only go to bed when i feel super sleepy, even if that means staying up later than i normally would 

Bed time restriction is something else you can try. This is a central part of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia 

I’m also experimenting with mushroom microdosing for insomnia. i think it’s helping me 

These are just some things that help me a bit

It wasn’t until I came off it that I forgot what it felt to be sleepy.  

Great job.  Small victories when it comes to sleep seem like major milestones."

9489,h7swgje,,,insomnia,1628169819,"Have you tried a different doctor, or ask for a referral from your current doc? Because, it does sound like you need some meds, at least for the periods when your insomnia is bad.

I understand that doctors don't like to hand out sleeping pills to people, especially if they're young. But when the pros outweigh the negatives, sometimes they're needed.

Meds aren't the solution for everyone, but if you've tried all the non-med stuff, then there's little harm in trying medication."
9490,h7sv2v1,,,insomnia,1628169148,"I haven’t tried the patches, but my buddy has a farm and has given me a lot of tincture he’s made. I take about 200mg and it helps me immensely. It allows me to alternate between Lunesta and CBD without building up a tolerance to Lunesta. I’m now able to sleep without lunesta at least two out of three nights, which before was impossible. Good luck with the patch and let us know how it works.


Edit: also look into CBN. It’s another non psychoactive compound in cannabis that is much more sedating than CBD. It’s a fairly recent discovery and has gotten a lot of praise"

9500,h7slv2s,,,insomnia,1628163975,There's something known as paradoxical insomnia which is about 10000 x more common than what your afraid of. The brain is sleep but you feel like you're not.

9502,h7sldye,,,insomnia,1628163670,Have you ever heard of dr. Andrew huberman?

I know someone else mentioned lucid dreaming, perhaps there’s a way you could learn to more fully control your dreams so as to make it a pleasant experience. There are techniques out there but I’m no expert. That could turn your perception of this from a serious problem to a gift."
9509,h7sdxsj,,,insomnia,1628158209,"FFI is a genetic prion disease, it’s either passed down or contracted by ingesting infected brain tissue.

Unless you have a family history of this disease or have consumed the brain of someone else who does, then there is little reason to worry.

I understand that those facts may not alleviate your concerns. It sounds like you suffer from health anxiety, I do as well. All the logic in the world seems to make almost no difference in whether or not we worry about something. I would suggest seeing a therapist to address your anxiety and insomnia."
9510,h7sdl3f,,,insomnia,1628157921,It could be a sign that the sleep you’re getting isn’t restful sleep. Not all sleep is good sleep! You may not be getting enough deep or REM sleep.
9511,h7sdaa6,,,insomnia,1628157680,"Fatal Familial Insomnia is genetic. There are about 40 families out of the billions of people on Earth known to carry the gene. Sporadic Fatal Insomnia happens too, but is even rarer, with only 24 cases described in medical literature.

You are more likely to win the lottery, or be struck by lightning while indoors.

Just because you feel tired during the day, have trouble sleeping, or don’t remember falling asleep, doesn’t mean you didn’t sleep."

9513,h7sd2ma,,,insomnia,1628157503,"Anxiety might cause you to see things in your peripheral vision. 

If you've not slept well for 2 days, it doesn't mean you have insomnia yet. It's probably some sort of anxiety or stress-related response. Try to identify the source and the sleeping should improve with that."

9515,h7scgy2,,,insomnia,1628156998,You will be able to sleep again. This  is temporary. You have a whole life ahead of you and your insomnia will likely subside at some point in your life. I didn’t have it all my 23 years of living until the last 3 months as well. At first it was terrible i wasn’t sleeping at all for days straight but now it only happens to me a couple times a week(like tonight). I got prescribed mirtazapine and i take it only as needed and it really does help me when i’m feeling desperate. Melatonin (the Olly gummies) do help me some nights. But overall the most important thing is easing your anxiety and knowing and accepting that this is temporary. The more you worry about it the harder it’ll be to sleep.
9516,h7sc0s9,,,insomnia,1628156621,"I have these kind of nights about once a week. it’s 5 am and i’m just now getting on my phone, feels like i was just laying with my eyes closed all night and no sleep. I just drink green tea in the morning and try to be gentle with myself during the day, if i’m home i just watch movies and nap, if i’m at school i just try to relax and not overwork myself. Just keep telling yourself that this is temporary. You will feel groggy today but this will all pass and you’ll sleep again soon. One bad night here and there is normal!"

Some antidepressants can be used for insomnia, I know low dose of mirtazipine can. Didn't for me and side effect was extreme weight gain but works for some people. 

Not sure what country you in but in the UK a lot of over the counter sleep meds contain antihistamines which make you drowsy, the doctor can also prescribe a stronger version. So if you haven't tried these and don't want to go down benzo route this may be worth trying."

When we lay awake bed thinking or worrying, we start to train our brain that bed is a place to be awake. If sleep isn’t happening within 30 minutes, get out and read and only get back when you’re feeling sleepy. It could suck for a days as you start to retrain yourself that bed is for sleep.

   I was burnt out and thought it was all due to the lack of sleep, the lifelong insomnia... but guess what? I put that Fitbit on and it told me exactly when I was sleeping... I was sleeping but not two or three hours at a time 30 -40 minutes maybe sometimes an hour when I get so exhausted I'd pass out but you know what¿   you can obsess over the app that comes with your Fitbit to see how much you've been sleeping or not sleeping... there's tools to get help..

So my lifetime insomnia is due to PTSD anxiety depression and borderline personality disorder.. not like fatal insomnia like I'd convince myself for years.

It’s a combination of things. Number one, some people in family have it. My uncle and one aunt have had it. I also have ADHD, anxiety, depression. Combine that with stress from work, family and other things is a recipe for insomnia. 

I’ve tried a lot of prescription anxiety, depression  which just make things worse. For sleep I’ve tried trazadone, and all the otc drugs.

Sooo many people come onto this subreddit thinking they're dying from fatal insomnia when its likely they are, big shocker, just tired from lack of sleep due to, again shocker, regular old insomnia. 

If you are truly convinced you have fatal insomnia, then go to a doctor and have them tell you you don't have it."

Increased physical activity, both in time and intensity, can help improve sleep quality and mood.

Also get screened for anxiety and/or depression.  Waking up early on a regular basis is a symptom of those disorders.

Use the hour before you go to bed as a buffer period to mentally disengage from the day's events.  Light reading, watching TV, a warm bath, listening to music, etc.

Fatal familial insomnia is an infectious disease, &amp; highly rare. There are only 2 possible ways of contracting it; either its passed down genetically or you stay exposed to specific pollutants that cause the infection. Your first symptoms  would be worsening insomnia, panic &amp; anxiety attacks, paranoia &amp; newly developed phobias.

Please do yourself a favour &amp; go to your doctor. A sleep study, PET scan, or gene study will confirm if you have it."
9606,h7qyr1l,,,insomnia,1628125119,"Hey! Insomnia sucks. I was diagnosed with Chronic Onset Insomnia about two years ago. This was after years of being “bad at sleeping.” I learned to live with that misery for a long time. After a bit of a psychotic break, well, a three day period where I had zero sleep whatsoever, I ended up in an urgent care looking and feeling crazy. They gave me some medicine to get some sleep, then I made an appointment with my primary physician where we discussed my sleeping issues further. He was already aware of my situation, my habits, and my “sleep hygiene” and saw I was in a bad situation. I was diagnosed and prescribed medicine that’s completely changed my quality of life.

What I’m getting at here is that I highly doubt you have fatal insomnia due to how rare it is. Could you have insomnia? Yeah, sounds like it. Are you a doctor or specialist in this area? I have no idea. Am I a doctor or a specialist? No chance. But until you start really looking after yourself and speaking to a professional, you probably won’t get the answers you’re looking for here, or from your family. 

My best advice is to book an appointment with someone that actually knows how to help you. Try not to go to the extreme of thinking you have fatal insomnia, and just settle with having insomnia. You have a condition, which can be alleviated with the appropriate care. You just gotta take the steps and try to keep a healthy mindset.

The body is quite adaptive when one area malfunctions and will change to protect other areas such as sleep. It may take some time for your body to realize that this frequent urination probably isn't going away, but once it does it will adapt your sleep."

9643,h7pdpm3,,,insomnia,1628099956,"I mean, yesterday, I went to work and it was busy. I clocked in and was able to work without any problems. I didn't feel that I slept very much if at all that night either but I must have if I could do the job and not feel extremely fatigued, etc.

I did have a throbbing headache come on in the evening hours while at work but I don't know whether to associate that with lack of sleep? I feel like if it were that, it would have came on a lot earlier. I took Advil PM last night to deal with the headache and for sleep aid. It worked for headache but idk how well it did for my sleep."
9644,h7pdbyl,,,insomnia,1628099797,"Were those hours consistent?  Did you keep a consistent wake time?

Consistency with wake time is one of the keys to regulating your body clock, which in turn largely controls sleep."
9645,h7pd6ui,,,insomnia,1628099738,"Sounds like you've seriously disrupted your body clock.  You can fix that by setting and keeping a very consistent wake time without sleeping in or napping later.  Over the course of a few weeks, that should reset your body clock."

9647,h7pbh5m,,,insomnia,1628099037,"Yeah, I've been taking the Benedryl for a LONG time but I still think it works for me. However, taking someone else could prove to be beneficial. It's just that in terms of falling asleep, nothing really gets me to sleep quick. I've always been one of those sleepers who takes a bit to fall asleep on a normal night.

I feel okay so far today, though I've had a bit of caffeine already so I get bummed out because now I won't know if I'm truly tired because the caffeine could mask that?"
9648,h7paqsd,,,insomnia,1628098741,"You're not going to die, so you calm the anxiety down and get back to trusting your ability to sleep.  Monitor the benadryl, not exactly the best med to take nightly.  Tolerance and withdrawal are a thing taking this medication."
9649,h7pa4du,,,insomnia,1628098486,I do all the time. I panic about it because I know I have to get up and take care of my kids. My heart pounds at night.
9650,h7p9wqi,,,insomnia,1628098398,"Well, it went from being like 2 something in the am to like 5:38 am. I found myself massaging my leg subconsciously and it made me wonder if I was awake doing that during that time gap or if I was sleeping. Surely I was sleeping?

I have considered the doctors at one point but 6 straight nights of good sleep last week told me that the issue is fixable on my own. I think I just need to get out of my own way for the most part. The frequent urination thing is what restarted this particular insomnia cycle. I've been to the doctor for that issue and nothing was really found. I was told I probably have a small bladder. When I was younger, I had issues with bed wetting and on nights where I'm really knocked out from stuff, it still happens sometimes.

I mainly posted all this for reassurance that I won't die from this and that I'll be okay. I think back to my 6 nights of good sleep as something that tells me it's fixable."
9651,h7p8nn3,,,insomnia,1628097891,"Couple of things, if you've been using benadryl nightly, tolerance happens.  I suspect if you redose alot like you described, tolerance would happen quicker.  

I saw you mention the pee thing yesterday, it goes away so hopefully if your worried about this when you get into bed, i.e. anxiety it will resolve.  

If you're still unsure of your sleep, 'did I sleep?' etc, this goes back to the sleep state perception that has been explained.  Keep in mind benadryl can cause terrible quality of sleep..

And have you got to the point you've exhausted doing this on your own and might consider seeing your doctor (get a referral to a sleep doctor or search for one in your area)?  Your body is telling you something, get it checked out."
9652,h7p4qib,,,insomnia,1628096300,"Hi, thank you for sharing this. I know how frustrating this most feel, out of the different medications you tried, have you tried CBN by any chance?"
9653,h7p07w8,,,insomnia,1628094468,"You’re welcome.  

On the Traz, should not go over 100, it’s sedation doses for sleep range 50-100, beyond that it hits different receptors and becomes more of an antidepressant.  I’ve seen some people take 25 mg, but the sweet spot for sedating for me was 50 mg.  Taken with a snack to aid absorption.  It’s a hypnotic, if you miss the window when it hits you’ll be awake on it while it’s hitting it peak.  I can’t really explain it so that it makes sense, but it either works for some people or it doesn’t.  

Sleep lab will rule respiratory like sleep apnea, periodic limb movements, and will look at your sleep architecture to see how many spontaneous wakings you getting during your sleep.  It’s helpful to get peace of mind, but it gives the doc a point of reference to determine and begin treatment.  

Most sleep doctors are practicing or even non practicing neurologists.  I’ve had two sleep docs, one a non practicing neuro and one a practicing pulmonologist.  

I completely understand about time spend researching on insomnia.  You’ll do anything to find that one thing that may be the thing causing your insomnia.  Anxiety trying to figure it out can be overwhelming ad nauseam.  I’ve been there a lot during my insomnia career.  Lol  A therapist skilled in sleep and CBT-I may be very helpful as well."

9663,h7ok0y8,,,insomnia,1628087696,"That sounds like plenty. Caloric restriction can yield insomnia symptoms but can be attenuated with high protein consumption which is what you're doing. 

Ensure you keep a consistent wake time, if you spend more than 8h in bed then scale it back to help consolidate sleep and build sleep pressure. Also helps to get bright light exposure in the morning and daytime. Other than that also explore with your doctor whether your medication might be exacerbating insomnia.

9671,h7oegxz,,,insomnia,1628085196,"Bad nights can trigger bad streaks, and the challenge will be preventing these. At least for now you know you're capable of better sleep. Do you recall what might have led to the first bad night?"
9672,h7odwp7,,,insomnia,1628084934,"All-nighters don't work well because they don't shift your circadian rhythm much, they just fatigue you. If you want your schedule back on track, you have to get up in the morning consistently and limit your total time in bed - in your case however, because you target such a drastic shift, it's pretty close to an all-nighter. 

It really helps to make use of bright light from the sun or a SAD lamp when you get up, and throughout the day. This is just like jet lag. It will take a few days to shift, not just one night. This will mean reduced total sleep time in the interim, because you will lack sleep pressure to fall asleep at your preferred time - just stay up late until you can.

9675,h7obycy,,,insomnia,1628084016,"The cognitive approach to managing anxiety is not naive positivism that you exemplified; it's disarming distorted negative thinking. These are not the same things. The latter exacerbates anxiety, for instance, thoughts like ""I have to fall asleep in 15 min or tomorrow will be a disaster"" or ""I'll probably never get better"" or ""there's nothing else I can do"", etc. You'll get through the next day even after a bad night, and you *can* get better, with vigilance and experimentation - in effect to be more realistic. Other interventions can lower your stress levels form sleeplessness and consequently improve sleep quality, e.g. yoga, the physiological sigh, regular exercise. 

Anyway what you're describing, the overactive mind, is common with delayed onset. In which case you lack sleep pressure because your circadian rhythm is shifted forward, and you want to advance it. Get up at a consistent time in the morning and limit your total time in bed, and use bright light to your advantage in the daytime.

9677,h7obkjf,,,insomnia,1628083828,"I'm pretty much the same way. I enjoy the weeks where I'm getting around 6 hours, but it's a cycle. 2-4 hours is what I get during the bad parts of the cycle. The only thing that helped is zopiclone during the bad periods. Nothing else (medication or other techniques) did anything significant.

If I'm lucky, I can keep that 6 hours going for a few weeks, before the insomnia kicks in again for another month or two. During that time, I'll take zopiclone for a week or two, then a few days without, to see if the insomnia is over. Repeat."

9684,h7o7xpd,,,insomnia,1628081998,"Research and use melatonin as instructed. It will work together with the chemicals in your brain that affect belief. Really take the time to see how it affects your body. 

They'll effect your cells and the other chemicals in your body and they'll slowly but surely start to regulate your sleep. Don't worry to much because that will cause stress and will release cortisol in your system that will ripple effect into causing sleep problems. 

Your body has just made lack of sleep a habit because it thinks it has to, to adapt to its environment. Learn some relaxation techniques and the relaxation chemicals in your brain will slowly but surely work together with the rest of your body to get you the sleep it needs.

It may take time, but understand that the impossible got conquered time and time again from people working together. Your lack of sleep WILL get conquered with melatonin slowly coming into the picture and working with the rest of your body to fight your extreme cortisol levels and finally get you the sleep you need.

It sounds insane but sometimes insanity needs to combat sanity. Just take a look at my post history if you have your doubts. I just want to work with you to get you the help you need.

Even just knowing what it does, your brain does the heavy lifting. The chemicals in your brain that affect belief will effect other things in your body and they'll work together to slowly but surely regulate your sleep. 

If you do go to the professionals, they'll take a look at your body and know exactly how to help you. If you can't, take the alternative of melatonin into consideration. Help IS out there. It's just that not enough people are talking to each other. The internet is beautiful."
9688,h7o55xd,,,insomnia,1628080472,"Olanzapine is the most sedating drug I’ve ever taken (except probably large doses of benzodiazepines which is not the best long term solution). The hangover and apathy was horrible (at least for me), so I switched to Quetiapine (Seroquel) and find it to be the second strongest with no other side effects whatsoever. I don’t remember my dose of Olanzapine when I used to take it, but it was a low one and it still knocked me out completely.

But experience may vary, at least give it a try.

It’s also safe to combine antipsychotics with either benzodiazepines or sedating antidepressants like the Mirtazapine you mentioned or Amitriptyline if monotherapy doesn’t work for you."

That said, first attack make sure you have no underlying issue or deficiencies, next attach go see a sleep specialist.  They will give you a sleep test in a lab, it won’t diagnose a circadian rhythm disorder, but it’ll rule out a few things, then move on to the next step.  It can be trial of meds till you find one that works (obviously better than the traz) and cognitive behavior strategies perhaps through CBT-I, ACT-I.

A MEDICAL professional really should be consulted to help people who have trouble sleeping, never make your own conclusions about the human body or psychology like I did.

Never sacrifice your sleep for fun stuff, it really does start to take a toll. My post history paints a very clear picture of what it did to my mind.




tl;dr See a MEDICAL professional first to get you the sleep you need for your brain to repair itself.


It's a powerful beautiful thing and it needs the sleep to become your friend again. THEN after they get you the sleep you need, if you've got lingering thoughts then I'd ask for therapy. 

They will do their damndest to help."

Made a lot of people pissed off and uncomfortable with the way my thinking got twisted. 

I finally felt sleepy enough to sleep my 8 hours exactly when I needed to and I feel much more relaxed and clear headed.

PLEASE admit yourself, the medical professionals will help figure out what you need and WILL get you to sleep exactly how you need to. Please take care of yourself, king or queen. I'm looking out for you. 

Please do it for me and yourself. Just look at my post history to see just what this stress of not getting sleep was doing to me. It starts at the first wall of text.

Mg is also necessary in well over 300 functions in the body.  Many Americans are deficient in mg bc they don’t consume it and I fact use more up bc if the processed crap they do eat.

I was embarrassed so I figured I’d see if it would go away when I went back to sleep that night. Woke up and it was still there. I tried icing it, cold showers, working out, Sudafed, and even a warm bath. Finally I went to the ER and they fast tracked me. I got 6 shots of phenylephrine and 10cc’s of blood removed via syringe. Still there! So they put me under and did some surgery on it. However, bc of the length I had the boner, there might be some permanent damage.

9804,h7m6obp,,,insomnia,1628034428,"There are various type of drugs and remedies. It all depends on which type of insomnia you have. 

You can try herbs (don't underestimate herbs as they have active molecules just as drugs) in higher / different quantities, for example 5htp+theanine (500mg + 500mg) is usually a very good combo. Surely it's the safest combo as it will not cause any daytime drowsiness, but remember it's not a ""black out"" combo, it's just extremely relaxing and distensive. Remember not to take 5htp if you are using any serotonergic drug. 

Going up, you can try 3 grams of taurine, which is a bland gaba a agonist, maybe adding that to the previous combo or just with 500mg theanine. This would add a gabaergic effect to the combo, forcing you to sleep in a more marked way. Just remember you can't take taurine forever as it's bad long term. 

Not sleepy yet? OK, let's start with the heavy ammo. 

You can buy benadryl or doxylamine otc in pharmacies. They are antihistamines of the 1st gen, extremely effective to sleep. The side effect is that you can feel daytime drowsiness the first days (usually 3 or 4 days) or you can have to halve the dosage cause it's too much. Usually a tablet of any of the two put me asleep in 30 min, and it's a very physical type of drowsiness. Not good if you have extreme anxiety, good if you are restless. 

Another good drug is trazodone, especially if you have depressed status as well but also effective alone (50 to 200 mg). You have to get it prescribed by the doctor, because it's also an old type of antidepressant and could be ineffective or even dangerous if you are taking other meds. 

Personally I'd avoid any gabaergic drug as ambien, zopiclone or benzodiazepines: ok, they work, but tolerance and addiction is terrible.

Don't even think about opiates.

Some tips: in addition to every drug I mentioned you can add 250 to 500mg of theanine, it just help relaxing a lot and is synergic with all the above-mentioned. Also, buy a blue light filtered glasses as it helps to reduce excitement from the blue light of the screens."

My insomnia is definitely psychologically. (cptsd)"
9812,h7lxhvv,,,insomnia,1628030081,"It’s purely psychological , you sort of brought out this curiosity “why can’t I sleep?” “Is it the door?” “Maybe it’s this or that” this creates anxiety &amp; in turn insomnia. You need to let it go. You aren’t broken, the bright side is you got a great new door. Try &amp; see it from that light &amp; don’t focus on whether you can or can’t sleep.

A long time ago they tried to say that my lowish thyroid was possible explanation for depression.  I took some extra thyroid medicine and it was a disaster.

9864,h7kln4c,,,insomnia,1628009855,"Sounds about right. Those “normal” ranges are whats normal for 95% of the population. You can be one of the people whose levels are still within ‘normal’ but they are not normal for you. 

They know this, they just think the possibility is so low that they won’t bother investigating more."
9865,h7kl3bg,,,insomnia,1628009628,"Yeah, I suppose so. It's probably that I just have a sensitive bladder. I had been taking 3 Benedryls but maybe cutting back to the normal 2 dose would benefit me. It's worth a try.

In past times with this issue, it is annoying to start off the night but I eventually do fall asleep. It's just that I either wake up later with a really strong urge to urinate or a wet bed. (it's embarrassing to say but it does hint at a small/sensitive bladder).

I'm not gonna do the whole ""did I sleep?"" thing again because I got out of bed feeling relatively fine and alert. there were some moments where I thought i could have been sleeping so i'll focus on that."

9867,h7kkiq5,,,insomnia,1628009395,It’s due to hyperarousal in my opinion . Fearing that a pill won’t work &amp; anxiety around sleep itself heightens this &amp; can negate the medication entirely. others who think of the pill as a form of “cheating” sleep can easily use it &amp; fall asleep as they see it as a form of taking the effort away. In actuality this proves that we make ourselves sleep &amp; not the pills. It’s a little ironic.
9868,h7kk5wi,,,insomnia,1628009249,"Thank you! Yes, I agree with you. We all deserve to be really listened to. I know doctors are busy/tired/ and also some doctors really do, do their best to help!

The reason I felt compelled to write a comment is that I have been going through the exact same story as yours. I mean I literally could have written the same post exactly. Exactly! I had the hives, feeling hot at night despite sleeping in a cool environment, the hypnic jerks. Everything!

I take 50 mg Seroquel, that does help getting me asleep in the evening (although I still wake up a lot during the night). Also, I suggest expending as few efforts as you possibly can in the evening. Personally, I watch a baseball game, and that's it. Nothing else, not even browsing my phone.

9896,h7k2ofp,,,insomnia,1628001556,"I'm still suffering too, man, 3.5 weeks later. the Moderna vaccine is fucking poison. 3x the chemical potency of Pfizer with no extra efficacy and recorded 2.5x more likely to cause side effects. fun fact about Moderna: they're a biochemical company (not a pharmaceutical developer) who have never had a product approved for use in humans by the FDA, and apparently they went through no formal process of determining the appropriate dose for the vaccine (Pfizer did) - just threw the chemicals in there and said ""yeah she'll be right."" if I had known that, rather than having it beat into my head that Moderna is ""safe"" I would have waited for Pfizer for my second dose. if it helps you feel better, I had a milder less devastating form of insomnia after my first shot (Pfizer) that DID mostly go away after 4-5 weeks or so. I'm waiting on this to do the same. I think some of our brains must be sensitive to the immune response/protein synthesis provoked by the vaccine. annoying because my roommate had 1-2 days of feeling like garbage, and has since gone back to normal function including sleeping 10 hours a day. my other roommate had NO side effects, and, again, is insisting that my symptoms must be ""coincidental"". 

my advice: exercise (outdoors seems to work better than in the gym for me - probably because of the benefits of air and nature), good food (chicken and sweet potatoes seem effective - try to avoid white carbs), and no drugs - no Nyquil, no sedatives; we seem to be in some sort of fight or flight mode, and our brain will work even harder to resist falling asleep if we try to force it or bury it under drugs. I've seen some folks here having success with Zzzquil or so, but for me the rebound insomnia from each different drug I've tried out of desperation has come back 4x worse, including melatonin."

If the evening walk can help you wind down and relax, keep doing that.  It’s to effing hot right night, I’m in Alabama.  Morning before the humidity and dew points rise is all I can do till it cools down.  

My house is kinda in the woods, built on the side of mountain, I’ve got some big ole lizards, I feed squirrels, birds, humming birds, I guess the lizards too.  My park run has a ton of geese, ducks, even one rooster (just one, I think he has an identity issue and thinks he’s a duck).  Where I live a meteor hit like 85 years ago or something, the lake has fossils from that.  Truly beautiful especially when the water has receded from rain.  

So, you need to relax, unwind, do not think or project negative thoughts about sleep, take your med tonight and see how you fare.  Best advice, get your room comfortable, equating it with wakefulness is common, you need to fix that.  Next, let go and try to realize you can and will sleep, your ability didn’t just up and leave.

Super hot and muggy most days but I like to see the little lizard and frog friends scurrying around (not so much the cicadas, jfc those things are nightmare fuel).

The atmosphere is just really nice and the change of scenery from being indoors a lot has definitely improved my outlook on wanting to be more active in general. I wish I could feel that positively about my bedroom! I don’t *hate* my bed, or being in it even- I just dread the sun going down because I’m in for another night of being the only one awake.

I don’t exert myself as hard as I could (as in, no I’m not doing wind sprints or deadlifts), I just walk. Usually about 3, 3.5 miles round trip. It’s not the most adrenaline pumping thing in the world, I thought I could just sneak that on into the routine day or night for some extra rest benefits but guess it’s just as “bad” for bedtime as harder cardio, darn. I will say it has made for some great legs though lol."

Well 7:30 pm to 3 am is already 7.5 hours, if you're in bed till 4 that's 8.5h in bed. You could benefit from limiting total time in bed to 8h or less, this can consolidate sleep and prevent frequent awakenings."

I’m still a huge skeptic with this steep dropoff from one night to the next, -6 hours of sleep on the same medication compared to that “honeymoon period” made me feel so let down. 

I tried the exercise thing too but it doesn’t make a difference, at night I’m just physically tired from exertion but it doesn’t translate to sleep. Doing it in the morning wakes me up faster but makes no difference winding down in the evening. I’m not sure where the idea on the internet came from to work out for better sleep but it doesn’t do anything for me either."
9916,h7jz0hv,,,insomnia,1627999827,"It doesn't seem as though idiopathic insomnia (for which the description is pretty vague) has anything to do with disposition to getting up early or late. It sounds like onset and maintenance problems with non-specific causes. 

If you get up late, your circadian rhythm is shifted forward. If you moved to the other side of the world, you'd shift, guaranteed. Chronotype is a combination of preferences, reactions to light patterns, food timing and social cues. All of which can be manipulated, especially this day and age. It can help to use a SAD lamp when you get up in the morning (or get sun exposure). Check [this](https://insomniasos.net/) out."

9923,h7jvvg4,,,insomnia,1627998359,"The first night I was excited because of the feeling that I was fading. I never get that. It was 10 hours of uninterrupted sleep minus one restroom trip, and I couldn’t believe my eyes when I woke up and saw the clock. Normally closing my eyes feels like they’re still open and I just wake up as if I was never out to begin with. Sometimes I sit up 10 times a night and can never get back to how I was. The worst was 20. Just up and down, mentally pacing, it’s frying me. That 10 hours was solace.

I felt a bit anxious last night but figured that because of day 1 being successful it was “all in my head.” When 15 minutes passed I started wondering when it was going to work, then 30. 30 turned into an hour, then an hour and a half. I took it at 11:48 pm and was still awake after 1, and I got up before 6. So I really don’t even think it did anything the second time because roughly 4 hrs is what I usually get to begin with, thus kinda rendering the “results” from this med useless? 

This wasn’t liquid, it was liquigel caps. They’re really small and that’s one reason I was happy with the purchase, they’re not horse pills."

I hope you get some sleep. I don't dread the night approaching as I did before, but some level of doubt is always there in all of us for sure. I remember fearing the night, thinking about it all day and all that, later I made my peace with it which resulted in better sleep for a while. I guess it is what they call ACT. Now I'm back to sleeping poorly, just with less fear.

To me an hour of sleep is not much different than no sleep, except maybe psychologically a little bit. How do you cope?"

I don’t think it would be the active ingredient since both the Equate (Walmart) version and ZZZQuil both use diphenhydramine but the inactive ingredients might make the difference? Certainly plausible.

The post was made about 30 minutes after I’d taken the first dose. The first night I took it, they kicked in within 15 minutes and I had the best sleep I’d had in a long time. So I figured the next night (which is now last night) shouldn’t take much longer because it’s just the second time I took it. Because I normally sleep so little (which is so bad, I know) I’m not chalking this 4 hours I got up to the OTC when it’s how much I normally get anyway.

I was hesitant to even take the aid because of the tolerance thing you brought up but I really don’t think you can build a tolerance in a night. Maybe you can? Thank you for the input"

I haven’t ever experienced psychosis from sleep deprivation and my longest was 5.5 days while withdrawing off medication many years ago, nor have I ever experienced it from THC.  But I don’t use it daily, I’m super careful to only consume the right amount for therapeutic needs.  

If you want to fix your sleep schedule, set a wake time and stick to that every day.  Set your bed time appropriately, clean up any habits you may have centered around your sleep, like caffeine use, screen time, doing relaxing activities and not stimulating ones 2-3 hours before bed.  Start dimming the lights slowly before your bed time, maybe listen to music (soft relaxing), read, meditate, anything you deem relaxing activities."
9958,h7j979h,,,insomnia,1627983495,"When I read the info on a bottle of diphenhydramine, it says take 50mg-100mg, with a max daily amount of 400mg. That would be for something like allergies, though, where you're taking it all day.

I wouldn't worry too much about damage. It's definitely not good to take it if you don't need to, and 250mg in one dose is high. But, you're not OD'ing on it, and long-term effects on the brain are mostly correlative studies, so I wouldn't take them too seriously.

But, yeah, definitely cut down that night-time dose. The real issue is that you have likely become tolerant to the effects, which is why you need to take more and more. This medication is intended for allergies, so the body will naturally adapt to the sedative effect from it, and it will not longer make you sleepy. That's great if you're using it for allergies, but not for sleep."

I csn take help but feel there’s a lot of anxiousness centered around your sleep, perhaps medication anxiety and add on that you’re deeply stressed.  Sleep deprivation enhances this.

That said, theres alot to consider.  Theres over the counter like antihistimes (not viable long term but can help occassionally), then theres actually seeing a doctor for more potent meds and or looking into cleaning up your sleep and any thing like habits that are contributing.  Anxiety, stress is another.  If you have this, lifestyle changes, maybe even dietary can help.  Have you had a check up and blood work lately to assure you have no deficiencies or other medical/physical cause.  

Anyways, I start with your doctor. Root cause or weeding out negative or problematic issues contributing would be my first point of attach.  Meds dont have to be long term, but can help manage if you need it."

You've already made a step I want to make, but am too cowardly to do, i.e. you are seeing a doctor for this. He/she will probably give you some short acting medication, a two week thing, and you will get your sleep back on track.

When I was in college, I went through 6 months of daily and nightly suffering much like what you are describing today, provoked by a stupid presentation I was  chosen to do in front of the whole faculty. Needless to say, I couldn't sleep for two days (and nights), and couldn't remember a thing in the presentation. That big bout of insomnia lasted for about 6 months, and just went away on its own. After that, I slept OK (for my terms) for four years, until insomnia reappeared, which it doesn't have to ever again do for you.  
For now try to believe it is a passing thing, it really is for the majority of people. You slept well before, you will again, everybody goes through this once or twice in their lives. Good luck."
9974,h7j2a9j,,,insomnia,1627977355,"Sometimes it comes down to prescription medications or no sleep. The problem with not going with medication is that insomnia can get so brutal it can completely ruin a life. To me, it's not worth living a life like that. I know how bad it can get and if there is a medication that can enable me to sleep I don't even debate it in my mind. Think of it as a diabetic that needs insulin to live. Is the diabetic addicted to insulin? You bet, but if they can live by taking the insulin it's surely a good thing.

I've never understood people that choose to live miserably with insomnia and ultimately die of one of its health consequences. I think the same about those that refuse to take the vaccine. I guess they'd rather die to make a point..."

How does it work? You sleep an hour a day or you sleep 3-4 hours every 3-4 days?

I've never heard anyone claim to sleep that little, and I have 10+ years of experience on insomnia forums. There has to be some sleep state misperception going on here, or you don't count daily sleep."

Yeah, two beers last nivht gave me 7.5 hours of sleep, but of course it's a long way from actual sleep, I woke up tired, but I don't mind, as long as I got sleep. I do mind habing to resort to alcohol, I hope I will find the courage to quit soon. After all, I have only been dping this for a few months, and I don't dring bottles of vodka as some poor souls who are too far gone have to do.

I don't remember my childhood sleep all that well, I think I slept OK until my teenage years, but I do remember never napping after school and never being able to sleep in, say, long car or train rides to the sea. Probably connected, again, to needing peace and quiet, not bumping on the road or people moving around.

CBT-I is a great tool and has helped me fix my sleep once before, but I was younger and also lived in a house in a village. Perfect sleeping conditions - dark, cold, quiet room. Sleeping in an apartment is more difficult, and I developed maintenance insomnia very soon after moving that still goes on today.

Anyway, thanks for understanding. New day, new chance. Tonight I will try, again, to ditch alcohol, but I doubt I will succeed, but one day things will even out."

About lucid dreams, I can't link directly otherwise my comment will get autoremoved by the automod, so just search for SSILD, it's a modern technique to induce them. Also another good technique you can use in combination is to repeat doing reality checks during the day, especially nose pinching and trying to breathe through your nose: in reality, you won't be able to breathe through your nose, but in a dream you will be able to. Dreams are made of a random mix of events that happened to you or that you witnessed or watched (including fantasy ones such as movies). By doing reality checks regularly, you likely will also repeat them during your dream.

Journaling your dreams at wake up is also a good technique to improve your dream recall which helps in experiencing lucid dreams, but it's not necessary IMHO, better do reality checks.

Finally, when you will become lucid, you will find that often you will wake up from the excitement or just the sheer surprise. To try to stay longer in the dream, turn around on yourself like a spinning top in the dream, there were studies by the pioneer researcher Stephen LaBerge showing this technique allowed almost 90% of lucid dreamers to stay longer in their dream, and personally it worked wonders."

9998,h7idqin,,,insomnia,1627960421,"Nurse here and chronic insomniac. First stop taking that medication, like tonight, it’s very dangerous and people can OD and die on it. Second, you need to see a couple of doctors from what you describe here, a primary care, a sleep specialist, and a psychiatrist most likely. To help them find the best treatment and minimize extra testing, go into each appointment armed with a list of what your experiencing, when it happens and any factors that you feel may make the symptoms better or worse. Do you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? If so why? Racing thoughts, anxiety, stress… what is your bedtime routine like? How consistent are you with it? How tired are you during the day? Does anything effect any of this? Going in prepared will also help with your anxiety, as you will feel more control. I’m not gonna sugarcoat here, you will need labs and likely a sleep study. There are multiple conditions that could be playing apart here. I had sleep apnea, and a circadian rhythm disorder (I get more REM sleep during the day than at night). So a bipap machine (couldn’t tolerate cpap) and adjusting my sleeping schedule worked for me. There are a good selection of medications that work for insomnia too. These medications do not make you sleepy per se. they work by either relaxing your mind enough to help you drift off to sleep(lunesta/sonata) or they work by keeping you asleep (trazadone/seroquel). The first are rapid acting with fast half life’s, so you don’t usually fell groggy the next day. The second are longer acting so grogginess is a common side effect. Ambien is a medication that kinda bridges the two. The solution will not come quick, but stick with it and you can start getting a goodnights sleep. Good luck!

Oh and Benadryl actually reduces your ability to get good REM sleep, so it’s not actually quality sleep your getting. Same with Opiods."

I understand the long term struggle. I think cognitive behavioral therapy helped me sleep a little better but I’ve never been a great sleeper and I’m not in therapy right now. If I get 6 hours I call that a win!

I hope you get some good sleep soon without the help of alcohol. Unfortunately alcohol only works for so long (just like any other substance, believe me I’ve been there too) and it will eventually make it worse. I understand though, the desperation of wanting sleep makes you try almost anything. Hang in there."

You realize they don't poke and prod you, right? They ask you a few questions about your sleep, ask if you've tried the usual approaches, and then write you a prescription. Usually, the first prescription is something like trazadone, which might not work. So, you go back, they ask you another question, and then write you a prescription for a real sleep med.

However, if you're honest with your doctor, they may not want to give a prescription for a real sleep med. You've been an alcoholic, and you're abusing OTC medication. That's not a good sign, since a real sleep med (a z-drug), could be abused by you.

10053,h7hccak,,,insomnia,1627942398,I keep going to chapter 3-5 on audible a few times.
10054,h7hc5on,,,insomnia,1627942317,Symptoms should be reversible after quitting. Nothing permanent.
10055,h7hbwtg,,,insomnia,1627942210,"Its fairly recent, the past few weeks. I don't take any medication either. I like to think I can get better without having medication trick me into feeling a certain way (i believe sleeping medication works similarly to anti-depressants, in that the 'feelings' aren't really yours), but at the same time I both love and study science and I understand the benefits, so I haven't dismissed it as a possibility."
10056,h7hbqcl,,,insomnia,1627942129,"Yes indeed. Although chronic insomnia cannot be cured, it can be managed well. You have a chance with sleep onset to manage you insomnia with CBT-i.

Good luck!"
10057,h7hb28m,,,insomnia,1627941830,So……you can feel free to move on.

10059,h7haywq,,,insomnia,1627941790,Mine is all sleep Onset. So thats good news..
10060,h7hamx0,,,insomnia,1627941643,You have offered the OP absolutely nothing to help his situation except the usual anti-medication nonsense.
10061,h7h8vmf,,,insomnia,1627940849,Hence why I have beta blockers 😏
10062,h7h8kvg,,,insomnia,1627940715,"Do you suffer from onset or maintenance insomnia or both?

Keep in mind that CBT-i can sometimes help a few people to manage their onset insomnia, not maintenance insomnia. Don't go down the rabbit hole if your main problem is with maintenance insomnia."
10063,h7h7f4x,,,insomnia,1627940186,"My heart feels for you!

You are in a hospital, I'm sure there are numerous proffesionals that can try to help you understand.

Maybe there is something going on that you are not aware of. Maybe there is some sort of a mental health problem that you are not exactly aware of. 

Keep in mind that sometimes certain drugs are meant to be given in certain combinations. 

example: someone given a anti-epileptic medication might need it not for epilepsy but for support of another medication that treats anxiety. 

I hope you get the answers that you are looking for and I hope that you get some sleep. good luck!"
10064,h7h76qg,,,insomnia,1627940081,Good for you making this important decision. One cannot go on suffering from insomnia as there is no cure for severe long-term insomnia. Many insomniacs have to be on prescription sleep medications in order to sleep which enables them to lead happy and successful lives.
10065,h7h6nrc,,,insomnia,1627939845,"I have extreme anxiety also. Try not to think about dying from sleep deprivation, you’re young and I seriously doubt that will happen. Keep working with your doctors to hopefully find a solution 🤗"
10066,h7h6ks0,,,insomnia,1627939808,"How long have you had insomnia?

Are you on prescription sleeping medications yet?"
10067,h7h5090,,,insomnia,1627939100,Just read this. Very good book. I’m practicing some of the techniques. Still too early to tell.
10068,h7h4qwb,,,insomnia,1627938984,"The brain fog is probably a result of the drug's anticholinergic effect.  I had the same symptoms and for the same reason. Also five years lost. Luckily,  things will get better after a while."
10069,h7h4q2c,,,insomnia,1627938973,Thank u for this!
10070,h7h4m7h,,,insomnia,1627938926,No. They integrate medicine between western medicine and holistic.
10071,h7h4gx7,,,insomnia,1627938861,Dumb question. Is a functional doctor the same as a naturopath?
10072,h7h3deo,,,insomnia,1627938371,Thanks for letting me know. I had never heard of an anticholinergic- despite my doctorate in google medicine. I do kind of live in a perpetual brain fog now which is why I wrote this post. Certainly not something I want to do for another 5 years.
10073,h7h2d0m,,,insomnia,1627937922,I have dealt with insomnia for a while. But recently it got really bad. I did go back to my doctor today and he prescribed me a different type of sleeping pill so I have my fingers crossed .
10074,h7h2biw,,,insomnia,1627937904,"I wrote about this somewhere in the r/luciddreaming sub, check out my history. I experienced this. Myself a few times in my life, though not as frequently as you. You're not really living a month worth of experience in a single night of sleep, that is impossible, but your brain creates a scenario where it feels like so.

Nevertheless, if this is frequent and impacting your mental health, you should seek help from a doctor. Maybe you have too long REM sleep so that you are dreaming too much. Another possibility is to try to learn how to become lucid in your dreams, this will allow you to distinguish dream from reality. You can then use your ability to become lucid to either stay lucid and enjoy your lucid dream, or simply ""reset"" your dream to be more enjoyable and shorter (a technique i did lots of time against nightmares).

I hope you will find something that will help you."
10075,h7h1xgj,,,insomnia,1627937734,"I have tried it, to no avail. I have never tried taking a large dose, it always just seemed kind of helpless."
10076,h7h1o8m,,,insomnia,1627937624,This has nothing to do with PTSD or CTPSD.
10077,h7h1n5z,,,insomnia,1627937611,"You are in the best place to be. Have faith, they will find the right combination.
Good luck!"
10078,h7h196c,,,insomnia,1627937438,Ah sorry--thanks for getting back to me though.

10080,h7h12ay,,,insomnia,1627937355,"Yeah,  you don't wanna do that. diphenhydramine is anticholinergic,  which basically means that your brain will stop working in so many ways. It can literally cause dementia.  See a doctor,  please."

10082,h7gwol4,,,insomnia,1627935427,"Have you tried Melatonin? Should be cheaper, and probably less bad for you long term, as it's a natural hormone after all. I'm not a doctor though!"
10083,h7gwg5u,,,insomnia,1627935318,The comedian Harland Williams did a joke about screaming birds in the morning. I will try to find it later for you guys
10084,h7gw68a,,,insomnia,1627935191,"It didn't help that much.
Although, the breathing technique helped me to reduce the anxiety of insomnia. 
Also he asks you to track the amount of hours slept, and surprisingly it also helped to reduce the anxiety.

I will suggest you go find breathing techniques, set an schedule and track your hours. This was the most it helped me."
10085,h7gvr3u,,,insomnia,1627935000,Yes but it has a long life have tapered of klonpin( been a week of my last dose? now on low doses of mirta I had exact same feeling how I felt I was recollecting those and u may have triggered lil bit of anxiety with me also:)
10086,h7gvaqu,,,insomnia,1627934803,But that’s also a benzo
10087,h7guvuw,,,insomnia,1627934624,I‘m even in a hospital rn and they can’t help
10088,h7gukv5,,,insomnia,1627934491,I was also feeling like  same you you are started on mirt was also klonopin for a while nom am doing ok not tht good but ok so gear up and fite it out
10089,h7gu3mv,,,insomnia,1627934283,I feel that my heart is struggling and I begin to be aggressive what was never the case before the sleep deprivation
10090,h7gtsls,,,insomnia,1627934149,"I started going on long walks around the city a few years ago as a way of getting into better shape. Exploring the city was a lot of fun, as was reaching all the different milestones. First time I managed over 10k steps on average for a whole month felt amazing.

However, it doesn't seem to help with my insomnia that much. A night of bad sleep can leave me feeling utterly exhausted while going for a long walk or exercising barely affects my ability to fall asleep or my sleep quality at all. Still, it's better than nothing. I can feel that I'm in much better shape now than I was a few years ago."
10091,h7gt3zj,,,insomnia,1627933851,"you need to continue with sleep meds for a while try mirtazipane in lower doses may be ..parallelly.. make lifestyle changes for anxiety control, don't loose hope my friend ..you are young ultimately your brain will find a way out"
10092,h7gs9hl,,,insomnia,1627933486,Please help

10095,h7gqg2n,,,insomnia,1627932692,"I know this may be different for everyone, but what time frame is good for a recovery period? One day off, one day on?"
10096,h7gqcbx,,,insomnia,1627932648,"This is probably one of the best replies I have gotten from a stranger on the internet. I'm trying to work out once every three days so I don't over work anything, but even this is catching up to me because its so high intensity and I don't get much sleep on recovery days.

It is def an anxiety thing with my insomnia - not necessarily bad thoughts, but the constant feeling of being in fight or flight, and like I have an adrenaline rush every time I try to sleep. Working out feels like it uses this adrenaline so I can sleep, but mentally the problem still persists.   


Thank you for genuine good advice and concern, kind stranger!"
10097,h7gq4w1,,,insomnia,1627932559,"I understand, I was in the same boat as you going to bed at a certain then stressing ""if I go to bed now I'll get x amount of sleep"" and the longer I stayed up the more I worried ""oh no I wont get enough sleep tonight I'm not going to be able to function tomorrow""

While I was on it, it really didn't tackle the anxiety part for me very well. I'm not sure if it was because I was taking too small of a dosage or my body just didn't want to work with it."
10098,h7gpnit,,,insomnia,1627932350,"Yeah I got a few hours qnd it was solid which was good, just a shame I miss a good portion of the day because of it"
